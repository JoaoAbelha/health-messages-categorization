But the first step would be to stop becoming anxious. Variations in pattern of sleep can occur. But this will regularize with time. So, try to relax. And to most of the sedatives (sleeping tablets), people develop tolerance, that is they stop working very effectively with time. So, try to develop good sleep hygiene. Sleep and get up at the same time every day, avoid smoking, alcoholic and caffeinated beverages and exercise regularly.  Hope this helped and do keep us posted.\n","It would be hard to see any significant abnormalities in the scans and tests you had, if it is something like costochonditis. The general area where you are affected is consistent with costochonditis. Look it up on Gray's Anatomy online to do your own comparison.It's an inflammation of the area where the ribs connect with the cartridge which attaches them to the breastbone and usually gets diagnosed by physical examination and medical history.. The scans and tests you already had, help rule out a few other conditions, some of which could be a lot more serious or even life threatening.And in saying that, I have no intention to downplay the level of your pain and suffering..I, myself, had a couple bouts of pleurisy  in the past, which was so painful and it made me scared to even breath, or change position!A friend of mine had costochondritis and it seems it took forever to resolve  (like almost a year).She finally tried a 30% DMSO solution with water topical treatment  a few times daily, for about a month , as I had suggested to her, before her condition improved.Note that DMSO is not FDA approved for humans.It is used for animals in farms, specially horses, for recovery from inflammation, muscle strain etc.with great success.It must be applied on freshly and a thoroughly washed body! DMSO is a strong anti-oxidant and also a superior driver, which can drive impurities into the body almost immediately!Can be purchased from Vets, Equestrian and farm supply stores or online.I have been using it as a constitutional  topical anti-inflammatory and pain remedy.It freezes below 65 F. I hope this helps, however, my comments are not intended to replace medical advice.Best wishes,Niko\n","Hi James,  I, too, go to bed by 10:00, then wake up after 1-2 hours, and each time it will take me between 2-4 hours before I can go back to sleep. I'm patching together scraps of sleep!  I found what is most helpful, more than any herbal supplement (I refuse to take sleeping pills), is to get out of bed as soon as I wake up. The longer I remain in bed, the more anxious I become.    It's important to find a relaxing activity, with low lights. I do yoga on a matt in the livingroom. Lately, I find that washing dishes or folding clothes is relaxing. So, I'll be washing dishes in the middle of the night! While I'm washing, I'll drink a sleepy-time tea, (though I don't know if the tea actually helps.)   The good news is that as soon as I'm done with my activity, and return to bed, I usually can fall right back to sleep. By the way, I usually allow myself an hour for my activity.   I gain an extra hour or two of sleep. Hope this helps.   Ann\n","Hi, I am suffering from the same sleep problems. Have your symptoms changed or gotten better? My body thinks its sleeping a full night in 2hrs and then I'm awake.\n","me too, it feels like its morning after 1hour\n","Read some books about sleep and you might get a useful tip or 2 about how to go back to sleep. My problem after waking up is making plans or even anticipating future happy events tend to charge me up, so I have a few methods to try to refocus on mundane things instead in order to bore myself back to sleep instead. One is to shut my eyes and try to meditate which often leads to sleep instead. Focus on the shiny light you see when you close your eyes for a while and try to relax while doing so. Another tool is consider only the 8 hours you are supposed to be sleeping and tell yourself there is no other time in the day. Then say \"I did nothing yesterday, I am doing nothing and will not do anything today either\" (just forget about the other 16 hours when you wake up and actually sb doing something.)\n","ill buy three hours man!\n","The best thing you can do for yourself is to find a trusted adult to talk to.  If you are in school, your school counselor can help.  Are there any adults in your life you trust?\n","Wow 20 days? It's crazy to me that school policies vary so much from place to place. That's unfortunate about your in-laws, and your wife. I don't know how I'd react in your shoes, either. My elderly mother was exposed (and thankfully is fine) by a friend who's daughter visited over Christmas and was symptomatic, and I'm having a hard time with that. I can't imagine family members who I know. I'm sorry your family is dealing with this. I hope everyone stays healthy.\n","Sounds like my son concerning  the speech delay . My son too used to say mama and stoped when he turned 9 months to say only ma... My son too was in front of the tv since very young age. But I stoped the tv and all electronic toys and he is playing a lot better: pretend play making food, serving food, eating food, and with playmobiles too. My son too likes to run, jump, play with balls and throw things when he is in free play...But my son understand somewhat and can follow simple 2 step instructions. I had to teach him that, and it took times. For exemple if I want him to give me the ball, I said give the ball to mama and point at the ball, make him take the ball and give it to me by doing the gesture with him. Then, we do it again, asked him the same question without  gesture this time,  and he eventually get it after some days of repetition. Same for close the door, push your chair, give me a hug, take your shoes and try to put them on, etc...  He eventually get it. But he is still late, as he should understand more difficult instructions like put it on,under, in, out... He didn't get that yet... so be patient and repeat everyday the same instructions until he gets it. Start simple like come on, sit, clap your hands etc... Then go more and more complex. Other than that,  I can't give you a diagnosis,  I'm just a mom with a similar situation.\n","Hi allThanks for ur replies , my son is 25 months now, we completely stopped the TV and all the electronics , he is much better now regarding eye contact and play pretending, we are applying a program that mainly talks about the TV and the electronics, we take him out for a walk every day for 2 hours, but we still have the verbal problems where he doesn't say an understandable word..

I'm down .8 of a pound, so \"about\" a pound, which is a little bit of a surprise because I had some sweets in the last three days. Guess they weren't enough to counteract generally limiting my dinner intake. I haven't been starving myself, but have been eating less for at least three or four weeks, and it seems to be working at a manageable pace.So, Barb, if one's fingernails are getting ridges, is that always a hint that it's time to check one's thyroid? I thought that fingernail thing just happened with the years. My doctor has several times resisted me getting any but the most general of thyroid tests. Wondering if I should insist.Weather here is typical Pacific Northwest fall -- a few sunny days or sunny parts of days, but generally cool or cold and rainy. Most of the leaves have blown out of the trees by now, creating big puddles at all the storm drains, which are blocked with leaves that don't let the water through. Kind of fun to watch cars drive through this but not fun if you get splashed. Also, the sidewalks are slippery with wet leaves lying on top of each other. I watched a dog on a leash slip on leaves and fall on his cute little face.Though the cats don't like the rain, they do still insist on going outside. They meow to go out, get wet, can't stand it and come in, then can't stand being in and meow to go out. (And since two out of three of them have loud, Siamese voices, you can appreciate that their constant loud \"rrowl-rrowl-rrowl\" is no fun to listen to.) In summer, they go out and don't come back until evening, and in the coldest stretches of winter they don't go out. This in-and-out stuff is reserved for the change of seasons.This week is the time for me to set up with all the jobbers we'll need for the new house and selling the old one, from an electrician to a carpenter to a painter for the high ceiling (hope he has a scaffold!) to the fence guy.

Everyone is booked so far out right now that if I don't get with them this upcoming week, I won't get their help before spring.Anyway, that's my week. Hope everyone is doing well!\n","I understand how you feel.  My primary care doc finally referred me to a pulmanary doc after I coughed so hard I actually cracked a bone in my spine. OUCH!  I've been coughing since March.  So the pulmonary doc increased my dosage of Advair from 100/50 to 250/50 and gave me Singulair, and Xopenex in my nebulizer.  Nothing made any difference.......still coughing like crazy...........so I called and asked for cough syrup and that's when he perscribed the prednisone to reduce the imflammation.  I've been on that now for 5 days but still coughing.  My brother also has very severe asthma and he says that the doc needs to find out WHY I have the asthma in the first place.  Makes sense..........so I guess I should see an allergist also.    I'm so exhausted from coughing, I don't have the energy to even go to another doctor.  I'm just wondering when and if the prednisone is going to kick in.  I'm supposed to take 4 pills per day until I feel better and reduce by one pill every 3 days after that.I hope you get some relief...........you are not alone............this is not fun, is it?take caresissy\n","Hi ShielahI''ve started to taper my dosage of prednisone down so that I can get off it........it really has not helped much and it is making me so shaking and anxious.  Thanks for explaining how it is supposed to work. I think the side effects, at least for me, are not good.  It hurts my stomach too, even though I take it with food.   I'm still coughing and I lose my voice because I don't have enough air to speak properly.I used to buy Benylin in Canada.......I don't think they sell it here in Florida.  I am going to ask my brother to send me some from Canada........I'm sure it would help.  It sure would be nice to stop coughing and stop hurting.  I might ask my husband to try to do some percussion on me.......but he's so strong.........he doens't know his own strength, I'm afraid he would hurt me without intending to.

Supposed to cure allergies and other health problems . In the book \"Breathing free - the revolutionary 5 day program\" author Teresa Hale states that carbon dioxide is not a waste gas after all and plays imporant role in over 100,000 enzyme pathways . She recommends shallow breathing when having asthma attacks to balance CO2 levels . I think breathing exercises worik in the same way .Anulom Vilom - Close your right nostril with thumb and deep breath-in through left nostril then - close left nostril with two fingers and breath-out through right nostril then -keeping the left nostril closed deep breath-in through right nostril then - close your right nostril with thumb and breath-out through left nostril.This is one cycle of anulom vilom.Repeat this cycle for 20 to 30 minutes twice a day(maximum 60 minutes in one day). You can do this before breakfast/lunch/dinner or before bedtime or in bed.Remember to take deep long breaths into the lungs.You can do this while sitting on floor or chair or lying in bed.Kapalbhati -(Do it before eating) Push air forcefully out through the nose about once per second. Stomach will itself go in(contract in). The breathing in(through the nose) will happen automatically. Establish a rhythm and do for 20 to 30 minutes twice a day.(Max 60 min/day) Not for pregnant women.

You can do it a few times a day. Also you can take Mullein capsules or extract and added to sny fluids you like. This also helps cough out phlegm. Coughing id your body trying to get junk out of your lungs even if you don't have infection. So once you get ang junk out of your lungs then your coughin goes away. I too have chronic cough that lasts about 2 months but with the things I mentioned above it helps make my cough not dry and cough goes away in less than 2 months.\n","That definitely doesn't sound like the right fit for you in terms of medication.  My son takes propanolol for anxiety.  It actually works really well and he has no side effects, just the control of physical symptoms of anxiety.  He only takes 10 mg though.  Not taken for blood pressure but off label use.  But in your case, you really need this to work.  PVC's are often due to anxiety.  I wonder if that is why they began that. Your blood pressure is still borderline but yes, creeping up. I'd consider another trip to the doctor to discuss a next step.  For many, exercise and healthy weight really help. So, consider some of the lifestyle things as well.  I agree with the question asked by paxiled if you have had any anxiety?  I think you need to dig deeper to what is happening as well and a cardiologist may be best suited for that.  I had my primary care doctor prescribe my bp medication and was lucky that she seemed to get it right out of the gate.  But when that is not the case, you go back and discuss other options.\n","I have found certain foods trigger diarrhea.  Nightshade plants and chicken. I kept a diary and it helps to identify.

I take Vyvanse, which is frequently prescribed for both ADD/ADHD and binge eating disorder. I don't take it for weight loss, but I know that it is often used for that purpose. I agree that the two medications you are on seem like an odd combo. I took Adderall in the past but felt very jittery and anxious. Vyvanse does not give me that feeling. Additionally, although I was not looking for something to help with weight loss, I did lose quite a bit of weight. In other words, there may be 1 medication to solve both issues.

Pull out method without a condom doesn't protect you from pregnancy but the condom you had on did.  So, that really is awesome and I'm glad you are protecting yourself.  With that in mind, you wouldn't be pregnant.  Pregnancy statistics when someone uses a condom are because the condom broke or was used incorrectly.  So, that's not you!  What you describe sounds like perhaps the sex and fingering irritated your cervix. Pink spotting is fresh blood and can happen if that is the case.  Brown spotting is old blood which can be dislodged.  I would not worry about pregnancy from what you describe.\n","Another thought, have you had your progesterone, estrogen, testosterone and DHEA levels checked? Having these hormones out of balance can cause the problems you are having, I ask because you said this happened after your pregnancy, so, your hormones could be unbalanced. It may not hurt to try some \"Bio-identical\" progesterone cream, this can be purchased at any health food store. \"Bio-identical\" means it matches your own body's progesterone and doesn't have any fake hormones like the ones the main stream doctors prescribe. It is very safe and can be used by most everyone. Dr Lee, the pioneer in natural hormones has books on it and some info on his web site. Also, please ask for a 24 hour urine specimen test, this will test for the adrenal hormones and is very good in helping to diagnose some of the symptoms you are having if they are due to the endocrine system, that is why I recommend seeing an endocrinologist.\n","UPDATE: Well I went back to the doc Friday afternoon. I told him how the Medrol pak helped and how the pain had returned within 24 hours of the last pill. That the only thing that would touch the pain were NSAIDs. So, since I normally stay away from steriods he said another round of Medrol would be OK. Also he said because the kidney function number he was concerned about was so close to normal and the BUN and Creatine numbers were normal, he was going to put me back on Mobic once I hit the 3-pill day of the Medrol pak. I also shared with him what I have learned from this site and others. So the game plan is to follow Medrol with Mobic and give it a couple more weeks. If the pain is not much improved he will refer me to a shoulder doc for evaluation and possible cortisone injection. Honestly I cannot afford expensive PT right now but HAVE been doing gentle stretches, etc. Knock on wood but I don't seem to have any range of motion issues if I can stand the pain. So, today shoulder is kinda achy but tolerable, today is 3-pill day so I will start the Mobic tonight.

This is just too painful and more trouble then I bargained for in getting a flu shot.\n","I apologize if this is a duplicate post, however, wanted to make sure the info got out there to those that might find it helpful...My detailed experience is chronicle on the following thread:http://www.empowher.com/community/ask/why-my-shoulder-still-hurts-after-2010-flu-shot?page=4My symptoms mirror most everyone else's...1) shot high up so much so that we talked about it for days after the shot 2) mine started hurting that evening, shot given around 3:30 pm 3) pharmacy came to our workplace and administered shot 4) pain doing all the things everyone mentioned with the MOST painful when trying to pull off a tight fitting garment over my head...just can't do it even now (shot given nine weeks ago) 5) cannot sleep on left side (except when I took the steroids, have taken two medrol paks and one 10 day course...doc said I can't have any more) 6) had initial numbness in my index & middle finger and some in my thumb, now just sorta comes and goes but not so much and 7) my doc was not aware of this being a problem and initially attributed it to other things, however, after hearing my explanations, what I found in my research, and the fact that he's known me for many years and believes I'm not crazy has asked me to gather the info I have found for him...much to my relief and amazement. In my hours of research I have found some information that was helpful. For one the VAERS site to report adverse events listed earlier in this post. I also was able to download adverse event data for the last two years...a ton of info applying some filters found tons of reports of this type of reaction. So it is not new. Also found this thread on another site with info that was reported in 2007 and even gave the condition a name: Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration, or SIRVA. Yes there is even an acronym for this condition:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Occupational-Health--Safety/Improper-Flu-Shot-Causes-Injury/show/1310784http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20955829As well as this HHS Power Point presentation from last summer where the last two pages discuss the above published info as well as thoughts on cause, treatment, etc.:http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/RJL-UptoMay-2010VICP2.pptAnd last this article that discusses the findings and recommendations in detail. Not from any gov't related side but after finding all the other info, I thought the article appeared credible:http://vactruth.com/2010/09/06/shoulder-injury-related-to-vaccine-administration/comment-page-1/#comment-2868Hope some of this helps. Based on what I've gone through I truly believe it is important for everyone to file a VAERS report of adverse event and talk about this so that more is done in evaluating the cause(s) and prevention of this issue. I look forward to reading your updates. And PLEASE update even if the pain goes away...it is helpful to us still hurting to read about those that have recovered...gives us hope! :-D\n","OMG......I got a flu shot on October 4, 2011. When the nurse put the needle in, of course it hurt a bit, but no more than any other injection I have ever had, however; when she pushed the syringe and the stuff entered my body, it felt like she blew out my shoulder, it really hurt. I was told that was normal, and that my arm would hurt for a couple of days. I was unable to lift my arm since then, and it has been almost a month. I went to the doctor last week, and he said it couldn't be due to the flu shot, he told me I probably have tendonitis and prescribed motrin 800 and robaxin (pain pill and muscle relaxant) and told me to apply heat. Well, I have taken the pills as prescribed to no avail, so I've decided to stop as I don't want to ruin my liver. I think seeing the doctor is useless, so I don't know what to do, because the pain is now going into my neck and across my shoulder blades, and I can't sleep due to the pain. I can hardly lift my arm, it is difficult to dress myself or do anything else that involves using my left arm. I will NEVER get another flu shot, and I hope and pray that I will be healthy again. Does anyone out there who has gone through this have any advice?\n","I recieved the flu shot 4 weeks ago.  I have had terrible pain in my arm since that day.  I can only wear clothes that are easy to get on and off.  Hurts to pick up anything, can't reach above my head........when I got the shot I was concerned that she gave it in the back of my shoulder?? I have never had trouble with the flu shot or any other shot before.  My doctor says it is just a coincidence.\n","They are both the same number but yawing two different mathematical scales. They are both your viral load. The 6.86 is the quantity of hepatitis c virus in your blood on the logarithm number scale while the 7,190,000 is the same quantity of virus but using regular counting numbers you are familiar with.Basically your vitral load is just over 7 million copies of hep c virus in every milliliter of your blood.Hopefully you will be getting treated and cured soon Best of luck\n","Hi.  I'm sorry you are dealing with this. You are right to be rethinking a \"full hysterectomy\" since the uterus and ovaries have lifelong functions. (Ovary removal is actually a separate surgery called oophorectomy or ovariectomy. Hysterectomy is removal of the uterus only.) You shouldn't need any organs removed and, at this point, there's no indication of surgery being needed. A 3cm cyst is small and most cysts resolve on their own. And even when they don't, the large majority are benign. Periodic ultrasounds should be the standard recommendation at this point. If the cyst continues to grow, ~7cm seems to be the point at which they want to do surgery due to the risk of ovarian torsion. If the cyst continues to grow, it is best to have just the cyst removed (cystectomy). Removal of even one ovary has been shown to be harmful. So you would want to find a surgeon who has good ovarian cystectomy skills.As far as the 18mm endometrium: At what point in your cycle was the ultrasound done? This isn't much thicker than normal when it is close to your period starting. Also, if you are perimenopausal (hormonal changes and cycle irregularities leading up to menopause), the lining typically gets a little thicker than normal. Additionally, if you have small fibroids or polyps those can be difficult to differentiate from the lining itself making it appear thicker than it is. What did your doctor say about all this?   If he recommended surgery, that obviously seems overkill. An endometrial biopsy may be warranted but rechecking a day or two after your next period would seem to be an option.\n","I had started to mention that an increased risk of ovarian cancer may warrant surgery but, for some, mentioning \"cancer\" can make for a heightened sense of fear that can lead to poor judgment / decisions. That was my experience.Of course, ovarian cancer is rare for the average woman. And I've read that only 5-25% of ovarian cancers are due to genetic mutations. Have you considered genetic testing? If you have a number of other female paternal relatives that did not have OC then it would seem that you would be unlikely to have it or get it. Also, based on my understanding, if your paternal grandmother was post-menopausal when she was diagnosed, there is a higher likelihood that hers was not genetically driven.\n","Covid is very unpredictable so it is not possible to know how long you will have those issues. Your symptoms have lasted more than a month so you are commonly referred to as a long-hauler and there are many others. There are long-hauler support groups and some doctors treat or study this phenomenon so you might consider those options for information too.\n","I had covid~ the delta~ in September. I took a mushroom extract which I think helped with my brain fog and fatigue. Vitamin B is good for fatigue too.  Eat well, exercise and drink lots of water while caring for yourself. There are long haulers but two months doesn't seem that long to me. Goodluck\n","Isn't vitamin B water soluble? It seems like you'd have to REALLY manage to overdose on it in some way (such as, taking prescription thiamine isolated from a general vitamin B over-the-counter pill) for the excess not to just leave your body.  It's the fat-soluble vitamins (E, A) that are more dangerous in terms of the casual at-home user getting overdoses, I think.\n","Hi callalily,I haven't had Omicron, but got the first wave of Covid early in 2020.I seemed to recover well, and my immune system did a splendid job, But since then my back has ached too (lower back in the SI joints) That bothered me sometimes on and off before, as I have some pelvic misalignment and probably slight scoliosis to go with it.But it has ached more since I had Covid.I also had on-going fatigue bouts. I had one today. In between them I felt fine! I am still hopeful that these things will gradually decline as time goes by. I am getting less fatigue now generally than I used to.I wonder if it has something to do with generalised inflammation. It's possible that diet and natural supplements might help to keep the inflammation down. (I am not good with diets, but regularly do eat healthy food, except for some treats...)I have to be careful with supplements because I have IBS.

Unfortunately, ovary (ies) as well as the uterus are oftentimes removed unnecessarily. Less than 10% of female organ removal surgeries are done for confirmed cancer. Numerous studies show that removal of any part of the female \"reproductive\" system does more harm than good. Your situation is similar to what I experienced 13 years ago. I was rushed into surgery for a 9.5 cm complex cyst that I told may be cancer. A frozen section was done while I was in the operating room. Even though it was benign, my surgeon continued to remove the rest of my organs. The after effects have been beyond devastating. My regret consumes my every thought on a daily basis.A surgeon with good cystectomy skills should be able to remove the cyst and save your ovary if the cyst is benign. And there should be no reason to remove any other parts.I have connected with so many women who are suffering after organ removal. A recent comment midway through this thread - https://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/2256660#post_14451187 - is from a woman (Krista) whose organs were needlessly removed for a basketball sized benign ovarian cyst. I would be happy to share the after effects as well as some studies if you'd like.\n","Hi shari_w.  Have you had any updates since you last posted?\n","If you don't have anemia, you don't have an iron problem.  Vegetarians should have no problem getting sufficient iron, as it's present and best absorbed from a variety of plants.  Examples are nettles, raw spinach, raw dandelion greens, beets, parsley, watercress -- you get the picture here, green leafy vegetables and others as well.  Now, just being a vegetarian doesn't mean you're eating well.  This is one of the great fallacies of the ideologues behind vegan and vegetarian diets, they don't tell you that it takes much more effort to get the nutrients you need eating that way unless you're born to a culture that is largely vegetarian such as India or Japan and have eaten this way for centuries.  But if you're European or American, you're so used to eating meat you have to learn how to eat all over again to be vegetarian and especially to be vegan.  However, there is another type of anemia that vegans and vegetarians are subject to, and that's B12 anemia.  There is very little B12 the body can use in the plant foods we normally eat.  I managed health food stores for years, and while vegans are usually doing it for ideological reasons and really don't care about health, vegetarians tend to be different.  Note that most \"vegetarians\" in India use a lot of dairy to get what they can't get in plant food.  Dairy is not a great food for humans, but that's what they do.  What most American vegetarians do, but don't tell you they're doing, is eating fish to get their B12.  Some eat eggs.  If you're going to be pure vegetarian, you'll have to supplement.  Another nutrient lacking is methionine, an essential amino acid that is also absent from plant food.  Now, you can make up some of this by eating chlorella, a form of algae that you can only eat as a supplement because it is only edible if you break the cell walls.  Spirulina has protein in it, and a lot of B12, but unfortunately not in the form the body can use very well.  You hear a lot about complete protein, and one way to get it is to combine whole grains with legumes.  The closest plant to a whole protein other than algae is soy, but now for reasons I don't believe personally soy has become a dirty word.  So while nuts and seeds and legumes have more than enough protein for most things, you can still find yourself lacking in methionine, and you still have the B12 problem.  The way to solve it without eating animal food is through supplements, but they are probably sourced from animal food.  (Dairy is animal food, not a plant, and not well digested by humans unless it's human milk and you're still nursing.  But you can get by with it if you eat fermented or cultured dairy such as yogurt or cheese or kefir, as examples).  Not sure this is the cause of your fatigue, that could be nutrient based or you could be sick with something.  Don't know.  But over the years, these nutritional deficiencies will get you if you don't supplement (some do this as well by eating a lot of nutritional yeast, a B12 fortified form of brewer's yeast).  Peace.\n","Hello and welcome to the forum.  Thank you for the question but we're sorry about the concerns you are having. What did the doctor say regarding your CT scan?  Is there a reason you had the scan such as having symptoms that prompted getting it done or was this a surprise finding from something else being investigated? It's important to know that these are most often benign. These are most often found incidentally on a scan and are typically non functioning meaning they don't produce hormones. A radiologist should have looked at the lesion to determine if it was suspicious which would prompt further evaluation. 9% of the population has these masses.  Typically a lesion less than 4cm is monitored which I suspect is what they will have you do but please clarify with your doctor. https://ccme.osu.edu/WebCastsFiles/1191Adrenal%20Nodules%20-%202.pdf\n","Hi,I am a 56 year old male and have some insight to this scenario.In my 20's i had high BP and it was investigated and recommended to just watch. Fast forward some years , i just ignored it. Anyhow in my mid 40's i knew the BP was going up and i still just ignored it. Eventually it hit crisis point and i could not walk up the stairs at home and had zero exercise tolerance. I went to the ER and they freaked. It was 280 over 160 and the hr was 155. They were thinking i was on coke! ( which i was not of course) Anyhow they admitted me and started treatment slowly and cautiously. They were happy to get it below 180 and all the tests showed collapsed EF to 15%. I left hospital 10 days later and had 10 tablets to take. This went up over the next few months to 12 tablets, but it was resistant at 170/90 to 185/ 95. I sought a new BP expert and he did some tests and changed the medications! After 3 weeks he introduced a medication called Aldactone. Its for an adrenal gland issue. Just like your injection, my BP dropped like a stone to around 100/70 with the new medication. This opened up the door to the likely hood of an Adrenal issue.  Conns syndrome is the name of it. Its was investigated and the results were inconclusive. I stopped the med for  14 days to enable some further  tests to be done, however the BP was straight back up to 180. This particular Adrenal issue is hard to detect and only a few places do proper testing. You should have it investigated yourself. There is an expert on it in Kings in London and he has some on line commentary that you should review. His name is Maurice Brown, you should look him up and learn a bit about it. It may not be your issue, but early onset high BP, and especially resistance to meds are primary indicators, so go get tests. Blood tests are usual, Renin tests and a 24 hour urine collection are part of it. They can do CT imaging, however the tumours (Non Cancerous) are often too small to detect, so  a special pet scan is required as the best means of detection. I am not a doctor but advise you to look into this to reassure yourself. (Just to say my EF recovered over time)Let me know your updates\n","Hi and thanks indeed for describing your experience. I'm very glad to hear that things have improved for you because that sounded like a rough time you had back then.Since I made the original post I have had some more blood tests. These have revealed normal aldosterone level, a somewhat low but within range renin level. My cortisol level was high (29.9 with the range being 4 - 22). Also out of range was DHEA-S at 687 (reference range 70 - 495).  I speak with my doc soon about these but at face value it would appear that hyperaldosteronism can be ruled out as all the relevant values fall within range and the ratio is center range. I suppose my issue must somehow be related to these elevated stress hormones be it directly or indirectly and maybe the problem is still at an adrenal gland (or both) or maybe higher up the HPA axis.But the question I'd really like to know is just what did the dexamethasone do exactly, what did it disrupt or enhance to have the dramatic blood pressure lowering effect? There is nothing online that supports dexamethasone as a blood pressure lowering agent and, on the contrary, it seems to be that those with hypertension find the condition is exacerbated by taking the steroid. If I could get an answer in this I might be able to figure out (or narrow down) what part of the system is malfunctioning.  Thanks.\n","Hi Sara and Paxiled, thanks both for your replies.Sara: Thanks for the verification on steroids and yes I do appear to present with the opposite of what one might expect. I'm getting some additional diagnostics in the coming days so I'll return with the results of those in maybe a couple of weeks time.paxiled: yes, as Sara stated I seem to have the opposite response/reaction, in fact I didn't know that anxiety was a potential side effect but I have to say after that 8mg shot of dexamethasone in the first instance, the following day I felt super relaxed - odd indeed! I did ask my doc if the steroid might have inadvertently highlighted an inflammatory condition I was otherwise unaware of but, like I said, she really didn't offer an opinion either way.  The condition I think might potentially be looking at and certainly worthy of further investigation, is adosteronism. I spoke to the Aldosterone association and I certainly fit the profile and it seems that doctors might be too willing to treat hypertension in the primary sense as opposed to looking at secondary causes such as aldosteronism which is a  hormonal malfunction. Anyways I'll return in a little while with updates.  If anyone else reads this and had a similar experience I'd appreciate your input. Much obliged....\n","I know these are years old, but did anyone find anything out?!? I am having the same issue my 15 month old and am out of my mind!!!

I'm hearing more and more that if you eat the natural kind of yogurt (with acidophilus and bifidus) it does all kinds of great things not only for your diet but for your brain. To use it for weight loss, you would remove something bad for you from your regular eating pattern, and replace it with yogurt. If you remove a food with a lot of \"bad fats\" and empty calories and eat a half-cup of yogurt instead, you will probably see a pretty good result. My nephew ate just a container of yogurt and a banana every day at lunch all through high school, (not because of his weight but because he didn't want to prepare anything more elaborate), and he certainly didn't have any problems with his weight even though both of his parents are quite heavy.\n","Foods that help you lose weight* Eggs, especially for breakfast, are a common food that may aid in weight loss.*Oatmeal: Eating a cup of oatmeal first thing in the morning may help you lose weight.*Peas, lentils, legumes, and peas are all classified as pulses as a group.

My 10 year old can easily isolate but my 7 year old, impossible. In any case, we are all so far very healthy. Unfortunately, the girls can't go back to school till 1/18 and the boy since he is asymptomatic, the school district has a crazy policy that the quarantine period for him is twice (20 days!). So he can't go back to his kindergarten until 1/26 but a negative test on or after 1/19 can shorter that to 1/24. The part that sucks the most is my household has been doing all the very right things (except that I couldn't convince to have the kids vaccinated, now she is convinced) but we had sets of visitors or 12/31 and 1/1 with the guests all testing positive on 1/2 and they had symptoms when they visited.

I took him to Toys R Us when he was 2 and all he would do is look up at the fans spinning in the ceiling. He didn't care about the toys. He didn't speak until he was 4 and he would point and cry when he wanted something until then. He never slept either. That was tough on me. He would take anything in the house with a cord and try to \"connect\" it to each other and make a train of my curling iron and hair dry and maybe an electric clock (you get it) and it would start at one end and stretch to the other end of a 2000sf house. He never played with toys they way they were meant to be played with. He didn't pretend with them he used them in different ways.  The people trying to \"help\" you sound like the same people I dealt with. I knew in my heart he had HF ASD and because I didn't want to make waves I went along with what they were telling me and I'm a nurse. I should've known better. My son detested reading and if I tried to read him a book he would take it and throw it across the room. He never let me read to him. He wasn't interested in kid's tv like other kids his age. Wouldn't watch Sesame Street and now that he's 20 you aske him about Burt and Ernie or Big Bird he'll says \"huh?\" My son has perfect pitch and can imitate sounds perfectly. He used to hum All My Loving by the Beattles and memorized the words and could sing it when he was able to talk. He always asked me to play \"All My Wubbin.\"  It was so cute. I bought him a guitar when he was a little older and he taught himself to play in a very short time. Musical ability is common with ASD kids.I still have trouble getting my son to answer me so get used to it. I used to think he was trying to make my life miserable but he doesn't do it on purpose.

The other bipolar diagnoses are just the ways particular people manifest depression and are mainly used for drug patents and insurance reimbursement, they don't really affect how treatment will go.  The problem with your different diagnoses is a problem with psychiatry, not with you.  Some docs are quick to label you so they can get you on a drug and be done with you.   Diagnoses also are subject to the same fads as everything else in life -- the diagnostic manual psychiatrists use is written by docs paid by the pharmaceutical industry and are very controversial within psychiatry, which leaves us lay people really confused.  If you see enough psychiatrists one of them will eventually give you a questionnaire and make a diagnosis based on it despite barely having ever spoken to you.  What it appears to me is that you live a very unsettled internal life.  You hunt for diagnoses instead of examining the day to day moments of your life.  Because you're so confused, I'd recommend that before you label yourself something or other, and because you say you're an anxiety sufferer, get into therapy with a good psychologist and give it a few sessions to see what that therapist says about you.  You seem to function pretty well in life -- you have a job you're able to get to, you work hard, you're able to travel, you have a relationship -- and we all have relationships we're unsure of, that's not unusual or a symptom of mental illness, that's a symptom of your personality.  So slow down, talk to a therapist, and see then whether there's a diagnosis or a conclusion that you're just scattered right now, settled in to a job and a relationship but perhaps not ready to be settled in to that particular person or that particular job.  Don't know, just saying, try talking this out with a professional talk therapist first and then decide if you need to go a medical route.  But if you truly had bipolar, you'd  be much more disabled by life than you seem to be, and would be alternating between periods of hyper active productivity and crippling depression.  If you don't have that, you probably don't need antipsychotics, which if you are bipolar you would need to take.  But nobody on here is an expert or can diagnose you, and if you keep looking for a diagnosis, a label, you'll end up talking yourself into a place you don't want to be.  All the best.\n","Hi!  I hope you come back and talk to us.  Bipolar is so different now in terms of how doctors talk about it and how it is assumed (and not assumed) to look.  There is bipolar 1 and bipolar 2.  My dear friend was diagnosed with bipolar 2.  She didn't fall into the typical pattern of highs and lows that people associate with bipolar.  But had enough similarities that she received a bipolar 2 diagnosis.  She started medication for it and it has been a blessing.  Lamectal I believe is what she has been prescribed.  Here is her issue though. She will take it, feel 'recovered' and good.  And want to stop her meds.  Sigh. It's a repeat thing she does over and over. And it wreaks havoc on her life with every interruption in treatment.  Her husband knows immediately when she's not taking her medication.  Try not to self diagnose.  Munchausen syndrome is very complex, for example, and to meet the criteria of having that disorder would be  more than a 'touch'.  Are you harming yourself to look ill for attention?  If so, then yes.  Please talk to someone immediately.  No judgement.  Mental health is a moving target sometimes. Anyway, let us know how you are doing!\n","Thanks for the input.

Doctors don't want to get into trouble by ordering things that are not \"called for.\" I might look up thyroid symptoms (besides the fingernails) and see if there are any I can claim, so the doctor has justification for ordering the tests. :-)\n","I now have ending stage copd,,,steroids  was what I had to take due to I caught hooping cough (which is what it sounds like)...they treated me with a cough suppressant syrup..I didn't have allergy endued Asama as they thought and ended in the hosp on 140ml of steroids...the syrup froze 3/4 of my lungs...so I am on oxygen for 24/7 for 2 yrs now...they said I either take the steroids or I die...so I took them and they said I would never get off them...well after 2 yrs...all my organs are now effected and I put on over 100lb in 8 mo. time and now I am too fatigue now to get around with the extra weight I can't loose and  now I have congestive heard failure, osteoporosis, with 7 vertebrates pinching into spinal cord, gallbladder needs to be removed, thyroid inactive,diabetes, pinched nerves in legs and arms, RLS,,...so now I take med's for all these thing that steroid caused and no surgon will operate on me...but I got off the steroids finally...and now I just got out of hosp for eschemic  colitis (heart don't pump enough blood tho the colon)...very massive and it either has to rejuvenate it self or have life or death surgery due to the high risk of lungs coming off ventilator...which is how copd with steroids works is you don't die of the lung problems... but which organ is going to shut down first,,,so my recommendations are if at all possible..don't take the steroids and have them check for hooping coughlots of luckkat2ray\n","damn !!! they just prescribed jy 3rd WEEK dose of steroids !! i am NOT taking them.... what is going on in this world that they can't stop the ******* common cough?\n","Woops, almost forgot............it's a dry, hacking cough that I have...........I don't cough anything up.........I don't believe there is any infection..........I guess you could call it itchy...........but more hacking.thanks againsissy\n","I can relate to not sleeping at night or being out in public with a continuous cough.  My problem began with going to an Allergy specialist.  I  no problem eating anything except store bought bread about five years ago. I only went to get allergy test and the Dr. hit me with breathing treatment and epinephrine because I had oxygen level of 93.  Sent me home with Singulair and Symbicort.  I took both for 30 days then got chest pains and had to stop cold turkey.  I did not realize the serious nature of stopping steroids without weaning yourself away from them.  Had total shut down in my breathing abilities.  Had ProAir on hand and had to take it every three hours for four days to to feel I was able to breath at all.  I started researching and I found that Symbicort can cause Adrenal failure and Immunosuppression.  You wouldn't think possible using medications for 30 days.  I began with having food intolerance to most everything.  I found I could no longer tolerate preservatives, food colorings, the list goes on.  I cough constantly.  Major mucus problems.  Really felt I came close to death.  After each meal, about two hours later I would swell up, then get asthma.  Asthma, which I never had in my life was now part of my everyday life.  Soon turned into upper respiratory infections.  I lost 20 lbs. because I couldn't find anything to eat that wouldn't cause asthma.  I found I could eat some Organic foods.  Mostly vegetables and fruit. I have been very ill for a very long time.  I found some hope today when I found that the medications probably created this horrific experience and possibly after a year it might level out some. I am using Prednisone in small doses to help when I have exasperation from the asthma. Sometimes small doses of Cyprol.    I am trying to use Tumeric, Fish oil, D3, Vitamin E. Vitamin C. to hopefully get away from Pro Air and Prednisone.  Hasn't happened yet.  I picked up Licorice Root today, as I heard it might make some difference.  This seems to be a good site to realize these steroid sprays are only making people sicker.  I realize that Prednisone is also a corticosteroid, but can't seem to stay completely away from it.  I have recently sent for a hormone test to see if my cortisol levels are low which is sometimes caused by Adrenal suppression.  Cortisol also promotes proper function of immune system.  I so wish to find a magical alternative solution.  I will never take steroid sprays again.  I will die naturally first.\n","Story sounds just like mine. I am taking the same meds but find no relief from this coughing.  I was finally lulled to sleep at 5am by the sound of my nebulizer but woke at 730 due to coughing.  Allergies are very bad this year and I can't find relief.  I am on week 4 of this.\n","Hi there.  My son also takes propanolol.  He takes 10 mg twice a day and is a teenager.  He does notice significant improvement in the physical symptoms of anxiety (still can't shut of the worried thoughts though, working on that!). Anyway, appreciate your information.  Why did you find this information out? I mean, what I'm asking is did you have a precipitating event that caused you to look into it?\n","I am guessing that you see two different doctors.  One for weight loss and one for your ADHD/anxiety.  I say this because       Basically phentermine is a stimulant (works like adderall), but works differently then adderall. I am not sure you should be taking it with adderall.  \"Phentermine use is containdicated in those who are:    Taking amphetamine (i.e. Adderall, Dexedrine, Vyvanse), in the last 14 days\"   This quote is from - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phentermine      I find it very hard to believe that when Phentermine use is containdicated in those who are taking amphetamine (i.e. Adderall)  that your doctor would say that they would not interact.        And Topamax is prescribed for antipsychotic-induced weight gain.    I have a feeling that your weight doctor is only going by a standard recommendation of weight loss meds, with out having a clue about other meds.  So talk with your psyc first.   While doing so - ADHD does cause weight gain due to impulse eating.  It may be that you are underdosed on your Adderall.   Switching to something like Vyvanse which lasts a lot longer might be a more effective (and safer way) to lose weight.   Check this link to see if your ADHD medication is actually working for you the way it should be.   http://www.additudemag.com/slideshow/212/slide-1.html?utm_source=eletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=march    Essentially, I don't think that you can take both together.  But, I am not a doctor.  Which is why I recommended you talk to a doctor who bothers to read labels.  Hope this helps.

You may very well benefit from taking a stool softener or increasing fiber to ease bowel movements.\n","Hi.  So, bright red blood would mean that the source is likely near your anus and is most likely something like a hemorrhoid or anal fissure.  That would be my guess especially since you've had some stool samples. But since you are having this happen, I'd see your doctor.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?  You're pretty young but they may want to check if you have polyps.   https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/14612-rectal-bleeding\n","Sounds like sciatica.

A series of surgeries gradually decreased these pains for me. Most notably, after I got out my uterus and right ovary, a lot of the leg pain went away. I had Adenomyosis as well, however, so I believe that was a significant source of the pain generator. I wish you the best of luck on your surgery, which has probably already happened. If the pain is still there, keep advocating for yourself. Those are definitely symptoms related to either Adenomyosis or Endometriosis or both.\n","This is the flu vaccine?

I have read a lot of comments ,and you would think that a Doctor would look up the reasons. I have had flu shots for years,and as a medical worker this was one I can never forget,and very worried as to what will come of this condition that the flu shot has put on me.

Any skin lesion that changes over time should be examined by a doctor, but determining whether it is malignant or benign can only be accomplished via biopsy.\n","Again, no special knowledge, but four or five years isn't imminent.  Imminent is very soon.  The problem with human life is you'll never really know you're dying until you die, and then of course you don't know it because you died.  You kind of know especially if you're very old, but that's not the case here.  To quote a cliche, we all start dying the day we're born, it's just a question of when, and we really can't know that.  Neither do doctors, though they do have a much better idea than we do.  I wish life weren't like this, it's awful, but it is.

Unless you live in a super sunny climate, where your toes are exposed to the sun a lot, it is HIGHLY unlikely.It's always good idea to see a doctor if you're concerned, but I wouldn't be overly concerned about melanoma unless you've got several of the risk factors - the most important one being heavy sun exposure.\n","No apology needed!

I don't know how you could get an excisional biopsy, except if by chance you see a very lenient doctor; but even then the surgeon would also have to go along. So it's not likely.On the other hand, size is not the most relevant factor. And btw US is not completely accurate, with operator variability the biggest possibility for different readings on length, IMO. If you've looked at actual sono images, there seems many times where the marker could be placed this way or that. I know there have been studies done where different operators measure the same node, and then the variance is calculated. For something really crucial, an experienced MD is better than a novice US tech.Or the size increase could be accurate yet the node is still very benign - which I would guess is the case.But the length is not crucial here, as the shape and the internal architecture are more important and are apparently still okay. There is that video talk I'd recommended long ago, on US of nodes. I think if you mastered that by listening to it a few times, you could be more assured.There are also lung granulomas in the mystery immune condition called sarcoidosis. But most likely is that the chest infection you had is still somehow driving the neck nodes. Let's see... easy bruising, neck nodes, lung granulomas, infection kicked it off, very lean. Take a look at the recent post here, \"Just to vent .... and see if a biopsy is warranted\" by Caris, which is similar to you.\n","I believe I read that post, but that person did find out more interesting medical finds didn't they? With my my doctors think I had histoplasmosis as a child (live in an area known for it, played in the garden as a kid, had what they thought was an asthma attack but never another one etc) I believe I showed you the sonograph image of the 3.1 big guy and even you had said it looked surprisingly unremarkable even for its size. I could post that again if you'd like, even next to the old one with it smaller.\n","There is such a thing as chronic histoplasmosis. This paper says that histoplasmosis might cause sarcoidosis, or that one might be mistaken for the other because they are so similar: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/crirh/2015/108459/Sarcoidosis can cause neck nodes. It is a mystery immune condition. I bring this up to reinforce that the immune system can cause unusual things and is not well understood.Yes, I remember the sono and how to my untrained eye it looked perfectly normal.Here's a thought: you can look into whether there are any exosome tests for lymphoma that are now available beyond the research environment. Exosomes are molecules that cells exude and end up in the blood. There are such tests for prostate cancer.\n","US findings are just a matter of probabilities, while the only way to know for sure is with excision -- though sometimes even then the pathology report is equivocal. It is rarely possible that a node looks benign on US, while in reality it is lymphoma. Here's such a case: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yskqbVbYo5A   Here's another in Figure 4: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392555/Just guessing that it's 1/1,000 or even 1/10,000 of benign US reports, but it happens.

The same for the immune system.A metastatic node is pretty much the same as a lymphoma node, except in metastasis there is more likelihood of flecks of calcifications, and new blood vessels. Nothing is absolute.\"That rules out other cancers right?

Well, not a debate . . . something we just wonder about.  She and her husband are fully vaccinated complete with booster.  They got colds.  They keep getting positive covid tests with the home test.  They DID previously have covid. Because they wanted to go back to work, they went to a lab and got tested (all previous were the home tests). They were both negative.  They took another home test and were positive.  I have to wonder if those tests aren't showing up some false positives (the home test).  I don't know.  I think I'd go with lab results if you are wondering.  The virus would be long gone though based on your time frame.\n","The home tests have a lot of false positives and a lot of false negatives compared to the PCR tests.  There's also some chance they can be affected by having had vaccines and covid.  I watched an interview with an emergency room doc several months back during a very bad time with covid and he said that even with the PCR tests he didn't settle on a result until there were 4 tests.  Everyone wants to rely on the quick tests because what they really want, and for very good reasons, is to get people out and about again.  It's been too long to stay locked down.  Mom, you said on here that you think that at this point we're all going to get covid.  I'm hearing the experts on TV I've been watching all through this and they've thrown up their hands at the horrifically bad way this whole thing has been handled by us humans and they now believe that with omicron it's just a matter of time before most humans have had it.  I've got a dental cleaning on Monday and I firmly believe I will be coming home with covid because the staff will have all been exposed during Christmas and New Years.  But when would I go?  I have bad teeth and a lot of problems there so cleanings are also important.  And omicron is everywhere.  We did this to ourselves by listening to evil people and now we're just stuck.  And part of what we're stuck with is the quick tests that have never worked very well but are good enough to keep society moving.  It's all economics now, it's no longer about disease.  It's all getting kids out of the house now, not about disease.  We blew it and we can't unblow it, we can just do the best we can now and study what happened and hope we don't do it again the next time.  Peace.\n","Well, I mean, if we're vaccinated and boosted or even better folks like you who are vaccinated and have had covid.  Most of us won't die of it.  It won't be pleasant, but we will most likely not have a terrible time of it.  Not a risk I thought we'd have to take, but there it is.\n","AnnieBrooke I switched dentists 3 months ago because he has a beard and likes loose straps I guess, because to stay in place it seemed to depend on being perched on his nose - It flopped down lots of times when he started talking or bent forward and I had to keep telling him it had fallen off. He was a great dentist who spent 3 hours - it was scheduled for 1.5 hours - cleaning out my old root canal because he had to do lots of fishing around to retrieve a file after he discovered that the previous guy had left it in there.

Lots of people take large doses of B12, but it's generally measured in mcg, not mg.  I'm not sure how she could take that much unless she was taking a whole lot of pills.  There are people who have a deficiency who will be put on very large doses by their doctors.  Most of these would have a genetic condition that affects the ability of the body to assimilate B12, and it would be in a methylated form.  Are you sure she was taking that much or did you mean 1000mcg?  As for how long it takes to leave the body, a lot of it will leave when she goes to the bathroom, but although it's considered a water soluble vitamin, as is folic acid, B12 does in fact store some in the liver.  The rest will leave, again, every time she urinates, and generally, it's not considered toxic unless for reasons other than taking too much, in other words, in someone who has a problem with it chronically. I don't know what you mean by her having a \"rosary\" on her neck, do you mean rosacea, a symptom of B12 overdose?  I assume she's seen a doctor, as she knows her blood level.  What did the doctor say she should do?  Did the doctor say there was any danger?  There are ways to flush out the liver, but it won't flush out everything, usually just toxins and not everything that's stored in there.  There are herbs that do this, such as milk thistle, but her liver isn't what's really in danger, and the B12 in the liver is stored to be used when needed, so since it isn't currently needed and most will be excreted in urine I don't see why this is a big problem.

If a med gives you a side effect, especially one as significant as this one, you probably shouldn't be taking that med.  There are a lot of meds approved for the same purposes because they work somewhat differently from one another; if they were truly all the same the FDA would only approve the first one and the rest could not earn patents or get FDA approval as they have to be different to get a patent and without the riches to be had from a patent there's no incentive in our current profit based medical system to do the amount of research required to get FDA approval.  The fact you get this side effect from one med does not at all mean you will get it from another one.  It's always best to fix a problem without medication, unless the medication actually cures the problem and you don't have to take it anymore, as all meds do have side effects, and for your problems though since you've had bypass surgery you're probably at too great a risk for just dietary and lifestyle changes but who knows?  Bypass is made necessary by too much oxidized cholesterol causing it to stick to your arteries, whereas BP and heart rate can be caused by poor eating habits or poor lifestyle choices that eventually catch up to us.  Sometimes you can fix that by changing the things that got you to where you are.  But when you do need medication, for most common problems there are lots of choices out there for a reason, and that's precisely because they don't all work the same and cause the same side effects for everyone.  Again, if they did, nobody would ever be able to get a 2d patent.  Peace.\n","Metoprolol is noted for causing dizziness and fluctuating BP. I agree with Paxiled.

If you have a similar reaction when eating a banana (or, to a lesser extent, an avocado) on an empty stomach, it's due to problems with potassium from fast-absorbing sources.  It affects heart rhythms, especially in people who have limited kidney function and/or low blood pressure; such people need to limit potassium intake and often increase sodium intake.  Another test is potassium chloride (No Salt brand seasoning), but that can give fast and nasty reactions.  Even a small amount in Campbell's Healthy Selects soups can cause strong reactions.Another thing that can cause heart palpitations is an allergic reaction, but tomato sauce is most likely a potassium issue in someone who has known heart or kidney problems.  The kidneys come into play because poor kidney function stores potassium in the body and makes it easy to create an excess.  Potassium causes heart palpitations in an opposite way to how sodium does; the balance of these two elements is important for proper circulatory function.\n","Meron po, Korean Red Gensing.\n","So, what did your doctor say about this?

T-cells are a subtype of lymphocytes and when they are high in number it can be useful to determine *why* they are high. One reason is that they are benign (not-cancer) and the cells are 'reactive'. They are multiplying because there is some infection to fight, or there is even some autoimmunity going on. That would be the most common cause. The second cause is less likely, and that is a cancer of the T-cells which makes them endlessly multiply -- each one being the same as all the others.The T-cell Gene Rearrangement test looks to see whether your excess T-cells are mostly all the same. If they are not mostly all the same, the terms are polyclonal or heterogeneous -- that is good. But if instead they are mostly all the same, that could be cancer, or else it could still be from an infection or some autoimmunity -- the terms then are clonal or homogeneous.So what you want is for the test to say 'heterogeneous' T-cells. If not, it might still be not-cancer. Going from the rest of your post, e.g. that your numbers have been high since 2015 & your flow cytometry was normal, it is very probably not-cancer. I'd look at your upcoming test as a way to set your mind at ease.\n","I unfortunately suffer from the same thing. I have always only slept for 2-3 hours a night and then there are some nights that I don't sleep at all and I can function just fine, think straight, help my kids with their homework without any problems. I have just gotten tired of nothing working to help me sleep more than 2 hours a night. If I get 3 hours of sleep I consider myself lucky that night. I use a Fitbit to track the two hours that I do get and found out that in those 2 hours I get more rem sleep than most people do in a night of full 8-hour sleep. I have been like this since I was a child so I don't know if this would help, but I am a coffee drinker. I found out that if I am having a hard time sleeping I have a cup of cold coffee and have no problem going to sleep and I do tend to get three hours of sleep when I do that, but if it is hot coffee it doesn't work the same way. I have tried leaving the coffee alone during the day but that doesn't help either. I have just figured out that if I keep going my body will finally give in to sleep and then I can sleep for a whole day.

Autism spectrum disorder, characterized by wide variation in challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech, nonverbal communication and strengths possessed by each person with autism. The causes of ASD are not known. Research suggests combinations of genetic and environmental influences both play the important roles.Symptoms:-1. Unusual or inappropriate body language, gestures, and facial expressions2. Lack of interest in other people or in sharing interests or achievements3. Resistance to being touched4. Difficulty or failure to make friends with children the same age.5. Unusual in social interaction; comes across as aloof and detached; prefers to be alone.This type of spectrum can also be known as \"classic\" autism. It refers to problems with social and communication challenges, and unusual behaviors and interests. This is the most severe form of autism and also the most common. They do not like being touched by others, perform restricted or repetitive behaviors, experience sensory overload, and may have issues communicating.Symptoms:- Failure to communicate, not meet eye contact, constant pitch level while talking, not responding to their name and repetition of particular behaviors.\n","thank you so much for ur reply.. we dont have any ASD person in our families from both sides, which makes genetic link not that high. not sure about the environmental one , as we used to keep our toddler for hours in front of the TV since he was 3 months old, till last month when he became 20 months old. the GP nurse visited us a few times n went to see him in the nursery, she mentioned that he looks normal , hugged her and play with his toys with her, she doubted ASD but could not confirm or gave us a clear answer. his eye contact got better since the last 3 months, since he was 17 months, but still we dont have a good communication with him, he says one or 2 words only; the main issue we have is comprehension as he doesnt look like he understands us or our orders, he understands only NO commands, he knows his name and responds to us most of the time .

Have you already switched your son to his new school or does he have to wait until you actually get moved?   I certainly don't envy you having to move again, but it could be a good way to weed out things you don't need any longer.  You're doing really well with the weight - I'd love it if I could lose 0.8 lbs every week.  I just keep bouncing back and forth, gaining/losing the same couple of pounds week after week. No - one mistake too many people make is thinking that age does all these horrible things to us.  Although our body does change as we get older, a lot of the things we put down to age are actually due to other causes.   Because almost every cell in the body requires thyroid hormones, a lot of our body changes can be thyroid related because that's one thing that does, often decline with age - thyroid output.   Although there are other things that can affect fingernails (such as vitamin/mineral deficiencies, certain heart conditions, among others), lack of thyroid hormones is one of the first things I'd test for, especially, if you have any other possible symptoms.   I'm not sure what you're considering \"basic\" thyroid tests - many doctors only test TSH instead of doing the panel that contains actual thyroid hormones, Free T4 and Free T3.   In addition, for older people (not saying you are one), many doctors also won't treat a thyroid condition until TSH reaches 10 or higher but many people have quite a few symptoms by the time TSH gets to 10.  All of that said - I'd push for testing Free T4, Free T3 and TSH.  If FT4 and FT3 are low or low range, I'd push for antibody testing.   The tests aren't that expensive and insurance should pay for them.  You can also buy the tests online for < $100 if your doctor refuses.\n","Hi, do you mean your heart rate, or the baby's?

One thought that comes to mind is either fibromyalgia. lupus, myofascial pain, diabetes or Multiple Sclerosis. Have you been tested for these? Also, food allergies and chemical allergies can sometimes cause the issues you are having.  Also, a condition called \"Candida\" can cause symptoms such as yours. Candida is a yeast infection in the gut that can cause a myriad of symptoms that can mimic other disorders. A stool and blood test can help to rule it out, but avoiding foods like yeast, wheat and sugar also help.I would suggest seeing possibly an allergist, endocrinologist or a rheumatologist, these would cover the issues you are having. Also, seeing a good, reputable Naturopath might be of benefit, that was my main doctor back home, they go in to deeper detail regarding the symptoms, order tests that \"regular\" doctors don't even know about, and will treat very thoroughly areas that need special attention. I hope you get relief soon. I, too, have had lots of the symptoms you have.

It would only covid related if it started only while you had covid or soon after.  The fact your daughter tested positive for those other viruses doesn't actually mean any of them are serious.  Kids are incubators of viruses and also get ear infections a lot.  Assuming your daughter is very young, kids don't have a fully developed immune system yet and so they get sick easily but usually not severely these days.  Generally, ear infections aren't treated with antibiotics anymore, as they clear up on their own and taking antibiotics further compromises the immune system, that's how not serious they are.  It sounds like you both have some allergy problems and possibly are not eating in a way that is good for the immune system.  If you didn't breastfeed, that also can lead to a weakened immune system in children.  It sounds to me like you both had a relatively mild case of covid and recovered, again based on you stating all the things you are experiencing you were already experiencing before getting it.  If I have that wrong, then that might be different.  I'd say you need to look really closely at your lifestyle, especially your diet and what you're feeding your child, and also at whether there are things around the house that might be compromising your health this way, such as mold, pollutants, and the like.  You might consider having someone come in and inspect the house.  Because of the antibiotics your daughter will be more susceptible to getting sick, especially more ear infections, so be ready for that.  If you have a good health food store near you, go and buy the best multi-spectrum probiotic from the refrigerated section of the supplement department and both you and your daughter should take it for awhile.  If you can find fermented and cultured foods you both enjoy, that will also feed the beneficial organisms antibiotics kill off.  Basically, for now, do the very best you can with what you put inside your body and in your immediate environment until some of this stuff calms down.  The rest sounds like you are under a lot of stress from all of this and maybe would benefit from talking to a therapist and find ways to calm down, such as exercise, breathing exercises, and meditation if you can find the time top do that.  Just take really good care of both of you, and get vaccinated, then get boosted if you haven't already done so.

Thank you for your question and sorry for the delay in response.  First, that is excellent that you are performing self examinations on your breasts. That's a great habit to get into.  My thought was you were beginning a premenstrual period which is when this happened.  Hormonal changes at that time can cause this in your milk ducts.

Let us know if this went away.\n","Also, some demanding jobs are very stressful, and stress can make morning erections go AWOL.\n","Morning erections are not a sign of anything.  Mostly we get them when we're young and then we don't get them much anymore, although obviously people do differ.  So don't worry about those, they're irrelevant.  But yeah, if you're tired all the time, you might have trouble doing all sorts of things, and erections might be one of them, although there's certainly no guarantee this is so.  Shift workers have a problem with their circadian rhythms often, which affects the hormone melatonin which sets our sleep cycle -- we don't all have the exact same cycle, but everyone has a normal cycle -- and melatonin is made from serotonin, so it's possible that some shift workers will get neurotransmitter problems that might leave them a little on the down side emotionally, maybe dulling their senses a bit and that could also be a possible factor.  Testosterone deficiency is less likely if you're relatively young, and I'm assuming you are as you're still concerned about those morning erections.  Keep in mind, the main reason for morning erections is that's when for most people, though again individuals do vary, that's when testosterone levels are highest, but for shift workers when exactly is morning?  And if you're burning the candle at both ends, working both nights and days, then when is it exactly you do sleep?  You can go get your levels tested, and they should have been tested at your last physical, but to truly measure this you have to get tested over a period of time, not just once when you might have just been at a low point in the day or a low day that isn't your norm.  But if you're thinking of leaving the job anyway, I'd just suggest that you see what happens when that happens, assuming you're planning on leaving soon.

Autism spectrum disorder, characterized by wide variation in challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech, nonverbal communication and strengths possessed by each person with autism. The causes of ASD are not known. Research suggests combinations of genetic and environmental influences both play the important roles.Symptoms:-1. Unusual or inappropriate body language, gestures, and facial expressions2. Lack of interest in other people or in sharing interests or achievements3. Resistance to being touched4. Difficulty or failure to make friends with children the same age.5.  Unusual in social interaction; comes across as aloof and detached; prefers to be alone.This type of spectrum can also be known as \"classic\" autism. It refers to problems with social and communication challenges, and unusual behaviors and interests. This is the most severe form of autism and also the most common. They do not like being touched by others, perform restricted or repetitive behaviors, experience sensory overload, and may have issues communicating.Symptoms:- Failure to communicate, not meet eye contact, constant pitch level while talking, not responding to their name and repetition of particular behaviors.\n","side effects may happen drink plenty of water will minimize it too check with medical doctor hope this helps :)\n","Hi,It would be difficult to say anything without a proper clinical examination.You are right in scheduling an appointment with your surgeon for a review.

I also have RA and have been on medications that have weakened my immune system.It was only after I pleaded with my doctor to culture the sputum that they finally found I had a grahm negative infection of pseudomonus ariginousa as well as positive for aspergilous. While I was in the hospital they repeated the x-ray and the radiologist didn't see anything striking but the pulminary doc and the admitting doc did see lower lobe problems, then had a CT scan -  BIG difference.

If you have a chronic condition please go a step further in the testing to a CT scan as most early damage does NOT show onan x-ray and if your immune systemm is compromised by steroids and other drugs they won't believe you have an infection either because of the \"good, normal\" looking CBC etc..CT scan and cutures  even if you have to pay for them yourself could save a lot in the long run.............. good luck  to all.\n","Thank you for the information!

So, this is a lot of numbers.  Based on my reading, your numbers would not indicate high testosterone level but you list a reference range that has it as elevated.  Have you been able to follow up with your doctor?  Let me know an update and we'll go from there. PCOS is caused by an imbalance in the hormones (chemical messengers) in your brain and your ovaries. PCOS usually happens when a hormone called LH (from the pituitary gland) or levels of insulin (from the pancreas) are too high, which then causes the ovaries to make extra amounts of testosterone.  This is how pcos is diagnosed.  https://www.webmd.com/women/do-i-have-pcos#1  Blood work and checking these levels is part of it.

Cancer can be a disease people can live with a long time before it kills someone, or it can be quick, but I doubt docs can necessarily tell.  Some people are very strong and others aren't.  I lived with this with my Mom, who was left paralyzed before the docs even could confirm she had cancer despite a couple biopsies (this was a long time ago, so they're much much better at it now) but she lived 7 years pretty much stable until suddenly she wasn't stable anymore.  Which means, for peace of mind, always be optimistic because you might as well be optimistic, the human body is very hard to predict.

I thought that while it's limited in lymphoma it's reliable in other metastatic issues?\n","The accuracy of FNA for thyroid metastasis increases if they chemically look for thyroid hormone in a node, not just microscopically look at the cells. You can check the FNA path report to see if they did check that, they probably did.\n","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4276754/Overall, the false negatives of head and neck FNB are ~7% odf all FNAs done. Of all those who did end up having a metastatic cancer, 44% started out with a false negative FNB. Younger patients had more false negatives.\"false negative\" means the FNB says there is no cancer, but there really is cancer.I've never seen anyone else's US report mention cortical thickness. I would have guessed that has gone by the wayside - possibly because it has to do with absolute size which is not a good indicator. FNA is good for ruling in cancer, not as good for ruling it out. A negative FNA would usually mean there will be no followup excisional biopsy, unless there was somehow strong evidence otherwise to suspect cancer.\n","So when it says '3.3 by 0.8 by 2.6' which is the short axis??\n","I'm with you on the confusion-they all say stable size despite jumping from 2.8 to 3.3cm long\n","There has got to be some margin of error, so that perhaps they can say that 3.1 is effectively the same as 3.3. But I don't see how 1.4cm going to 2.6 can be called unchanged. The same for 2.1 going to 1.5. But that one also seems an odd thing to happen, when no other dimension gets smaller. Cancer would not get smaller like that, so it would have to be a reduction in inflammation or else more likely just operator error/variance.I'd have to guess that the radiologist is just assuming that the changes are due to operator error/variance, since the architecture remained the same. Researchers actually do run studies where they have more than one operator scan the same node(s), and then they calculate the amount of variability between operators. New sono techs are more likely to make inaccurate measurements.Btw, an echocardiogram is also ultrasound. I've seen more than one real life case where the results were way wrong, in which instance they either have a very experienced MD redo it or else they switch to a more accurate type of scan (MUGA, which uses radiation not sound).\n","Hi.  So sorry you have to have this worry, sweetie. I know it is scary.  Now, this is just my non medical doctor take on what you've written Shari, but you seem to look to have just a complex cyst and not ovarian cancer.  The blood work so far that you have reported here does not seem to indicate cancer.  They probably won't one hundred percent know until they remove it and biopsy it.  But they'll have a strong indication when they choose if you will go to a regular doctor to remove it or a gyn onc type of doctor.  When my mother in law had ovarian cancer, she was immediately referred to a specialist in the area of treating women's cancers.  When are the marker tests due back?CA125 can be elevated for different reasons than cancer but yours does not appear elevated.  Did I miss your age, by the way?  And you've had a  hysterectomy?   Big hugs.  I know you are worried.\n","I would think that the steroid use has played some role.  Odd your cortisol is elevated for adrenal numbers are within normal.  I'd have guessed that your aldosterone level would have been elevated as well. I'm not sure if you are going to get a specific answer but your cardiologist will best be able to direct you.  I'm following your story so update when you can.\n","Hi Specialmom. Thanks for your input and interest. As an update it appears that I have reached the limit of usefulness with my doctor. I had self-referred to a cardiologist who, after putting me through a variety of cardiac tests (ECG, Echo, 14-days wearing a heart monitor) politely informed me I had wasted my money because there were no observable heart issues whatsoever. However, he did not (or maybe could not) answer my question about how dexamethasone might induce a fall in BP in some subjects.Since seeing the cardiologist I have had some tests done with my own doctor (as detailed above). As I reported,  DHEA-S levels were significantly elevated as was cortisol. Aldosterone and a range of other tested hormones was normal. However, even with this new high-cortisol finding my doctor could not offer an explanation on the apparent relationship between dexamethasone and my blood pressure so the medication I am taking for hypertension has little to no appreciable effect. (although that might not be a strictly accurate statement because I have not actually completely ceased the therapy, but I do know that dosage changes have had no effect and some of my lowest blood pressure readings have been seen at or beyond the end of the dosing cycle). All my doctor would say on the subject was that \"I respond in the opposite way to most people\". As an engineer I find this an utterly frustrating and unhelpful response to a curious problem. I have got an appointment to see an endocrinologist which I had to insist on with my doctor to get the referral. This is in a few weeks. I am hoping they can examine and explain this interaction of how dexamethasone is acting on the HPA axis which in turn is modifying cortisol production. Cushing's (elevated cortisol due to a malfunction of the adrenal gland itself or HPA-axis system component) has been ruled out, I am told. But either way dexamethasone seems to dramatically reduce my blood pressure where all traditional BP meds have failed and this is completely the opposite response most people (especially hyptertensives) where we see an increase in BP.I will keep you posted. Thanks again.....\n","Just to say, most people don't get anxious from steroids.  Because they are stimulating and humans who aren't anxious love stimulation (see coffee, sugar, amphetamines, etc.), if you don't get anxious but do get stimulated it can make you feel great, especially if you're getting older and don't quite have the testosterone and youthful energy you once did.  Doesn't make it good for you, it's not, but again, getting anxious is a side effect that most don't get.  Bummer when you do, though, and not easy on those of us who have anxiety problems to begin with.  Hope it works out for you.\n","This is odd.  Steroids often cause anxiety; it's basically adrenaline.  So you're right, if anything, it should raise bp.  What you might do is find a specialist rather than your regular doc and see if there are any inflammatory conditions that elevate BP, as steroids are used to lower inflammation.  You can't of course take them regularly, as they are horrid to your immune system and can destroy connective tissue.  It would also be beneficial to pay close attention to your blood tests and see if any of your electrolytes are out of balance.  Make sure you hydrate sufficiently when you exercise.  I have no expertise to offer, but again, if there are inflammatory conditions that contribute to high BP, could be it.  Could even be something you're eating or not eating.\n","Hello and welcome to the forum. We appreciate how well you articulated your question and that you have come here to ask it.  We're sorry as it seems you are unhappy with your doctor. As a consumer in healthcare, you should always feel free to find another that has a more suitable style to what you like in a care provider.  Corticosteriods are more known for elevating blood pressure than lowering it. Taking a corticosteriod causes the body holds on to sodium and loses potassium. This change in electrolyte balance can cause fluid retention, bloating and weight gain. When you are retaining water, it increases the total volume of fluid that is being pushed through your blood vessels by your heart and this can cause increases in your blood pressure.  You may be having a more rare reaction with the lowering of your blood pressure.  It does seem to be correlated with your  careful observation.  Have you considered going to a specialist like a cardiologist?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK13780/\n","I just found something about blood sugar issues - causes vomiting at night without any other symptoms...listed as an over-looked cause.

But talking to yourself, pretty common.  :>)\n","That is really tough when a medication causes weight gain; I'm glad you're on top of it and figured it out as early as you did.I've been thinking back to the time we began checking in about weight loss. I signed on originally because my weight had gone up, bit by bit, 12-15 pounds over a long period of years, and I didn't want the trajectory to continue.  I didn't look chubby if you saw me on the street, but I wanted to drop ten or 12 pounds. But what they say about \"the last ten pounds is the hardest\" has proven to be true. After knocking out five pounds that stayed off, I've been in more or less (+/- 1-2 lbs.) the same range at weigh-in for months, with little losses every week followed by a week of a gain of one or two pounds, then little losses every week after that. It's not helpful for \"vanity motivation\" that my old clothes never stopped fitting (except those skirts with binding waistbands). And my blood pressure is low, and my cholesterol level is average, so there isn't a lot of \"health motivation\" either. I also don't lose reliably in the places I want to lose, I seem to lose in my arms and legs. That said, I *have* been able to finally stop drinking Dr. Pepper.  I didn't want to get diabetes and didn't want to add to my chances of getting Alzheimer's, and that was finally enough motivation. Also, my son changed to a vegetarian diet, and even though my husband and I both still like steaks, chili, stew and beef-barley soup, I cook a lot less red meat and even less chicken now, so we can eat together. We eat more fish and grain-based meals.I guess this is all a way to say that if I really want to lose the next 5 lbs., I need a less laissez-faire way to think about my diet, and a more structured exercise program. Life hasn't offered a lot of time to think about this just now, with the house change and my son having a difficult time in school, but I can get there. Anyway, I'm down .4 of a pound today, so yay! Have a great week.\n","It's kind of the pits when doctors \"know\" one has an issue with something like weight, but keep prescribing medications that cause it or prevent loss.   This is really hard for me because I'm at my highest weight ever and since most of my life, I didn't have a problem with my weight, it's very frustrating.  I think you've done a really good job of keeping your weight in check, in spite of the Dr Pepper.  It's great that you've finally been able to kick that habit.  I think as we get older, it's more necessary to implement an exercise routine, even if it's only a few minutes/day because our metabolism slows down and for me, with the thyroid issue, it's even slower than most people my age.   You've had a lot going on, which I'm sure is causing some stress that could be contributing to you weight loss.  I don't eat as much when I'm stressed as normal.  When you get the house ready and get moved, you'll have time to implement an exercise routine.  Maybe you can get your son to join you for a short period; exercise can ease stress so it might help him with the adjustment he's going through.  Congratulations on your 0.4 pounds loss.   I'm happy to say I've managed to drop 3 of the excess pounds I picked up as a result of fluid buildup and the medication.   I'm sure part of that is because without that medication, I don't dare eat anything after about 7:00 pm or I end up with acid reflux all night.   I hope I can keep those pounds off until this week's weigh in!!  :-)\n","Hello.

That makes the medication the most likely culprit n my mind.  Meds have all manner of nasty side effects for some people and not for others, but any med that lowers blood pressure or slows down the heart rate would have the potential to sedate you or make you dizzy because of interfering with normal blood flow.

He gave me a prescription for 30 mg capsules which are not much more expensive than the 15 mg. I was buying them at Costco for about $.25/cap. I would open the capsule up and dump about  1/2  of the powder in my mouth, put the cap back on and use the other half the next night. Eventually I was able to get seven hours of sound sleep on  1/4  to 1/3 of the capsule. I recently moved over seas and have a difficult time obtaining them and take whatever I'm able to get here.

My doctor increased my mg on the Lunesta from 2 mg to 3 mg (he didn't want to at first) but I still didn't get the results of staying asleep.  I know the Temazepam (Restoril) is a benzodiazepine and I've been tapering off Ativan, which is in the same family.  So that's why I worry about Ativan and the Tenazepam.  Both are Benzo's.

We also don't know your condition -- devil's claw is one good herb for your condition, but it also contains a little of the acid that causes aspirin to cause internal bleeding, so if you have that problem you might want to go easy on it.  If you don't, it's fine.  There are many herbs that are anti-inflammatory in action.  Two used often with RA are the one you mentioned and boswellia.  There's also turmeric, ginger, fish oil, proteolytic enzymes taken between meals, and, really, just a host of things out there to try.  But since you don't know your herbs and we don't know your overall condition, the best thing to do is get a good book on the subject and how natural healing is done.  Diet will be a part of it, as many foods are pro-inflammatory for most people, such as wheat and dairy, and nightshade plants have been implicated in some people with RA.

Frankly, when you take herbs for anti-inflammatory (as well as most purposes), it's not how much you use as much as how often so that they stay in the system, and all of these herbs were used long before we learned that black pepper contains bioperine and that might make things absorb better.  And never underestimate the power of placebo.  It's really and truly the best medicine when it works.\n","So have you replaced the warfarin with the turmeric?  That's pretty cool.\n","Yes!!

What I would suggest is adopting a permanent way of eating that works for you rather than using this particular holiday (or any holiday) for weight purposes as short term changes in eating don't alter your basic metabolism, which is the key to long-term success in maintaining a weight you're happy with.  And, of course, honey isn't a diet food.  It can be used for cleansing and for clearing the sinuses and lungs, but honey will never be a weight-loss food.  Better to just juice plain fruits and vegetables without added sugar if weight and health is your purpose in drinking them.  And have a great holiday!\n","Sorry to hear that you feel every PAC which is unlucky as everybody gets them an the vast majority don't feel them the way you do.  Yours doesn't sound frequent enough to have any correlation with increased risk for AF.  Even if you end up in AF, there is no acute risk of dying although the risk for stroke goes up.  I suggest keeping a journal of whether your PACs correlate with what you eat, drink and how you exercise (over training can do it).  Make sure you magnesium and potassium levels are in range.  Even in the worse case where you do end up with AF years down the road, ablation can cure it if you catch it while it is still paroxysmal, if you find a center that does a high volume.  A top level operator will do 200 AF ablations or more per year.  \n","This is the first mention of mine that this has been an issue for me in close to 20 years.  But I'm at point that I don't really want to tell my loved ones an put them thru that but I'm acknowledging I need help.  Even tho I've been thru this before I don't know where to go/what to do.  It's crept up on me the last few months. I live in a pArt of the country where size is paramount and my friends who Are fabulous, all of them run marathons and are obsessed with nutrition.  I'm meant to be a laid back person but I can't in this atmosphere. But these are my friends and family and this is home. Anyway I struggled in my teens and early 20s with bulimia and conquered it largely I thought with the occasional non severe reappearance.  But the last few months it's becoming reminiscent of what it was at its worst. And I think I need help but I don't want to tell anyone that personally and don't know who can really help me at this point anyway (been thru therapy losts...maybe a nutritionist?).  I'm losing reality on what my body actually looks like, I'm losing concept of eating appropriately and what full means, things I haven't screwed up in years. I'm 5'9\" and weigh about 125 but look 10x bigger to myself, I have no concept of anything! I know I could say more but this is my first attemp to reach out for help and I want to see what anyone's thoughts are first. Thank you so very much for listening, and hopefully responding. I'm hoping you are doing better than I !\n","Hello, I work in neurophysiology and spine surgery. It sounds from your MRI that your back pain may not be nerve related. If your doctors did not find any stenosis, foraminal narrowing, or disc herniations, then I would trust them on that. You may have a painful muscle spasm or something else going on. Most patients that we see will not need surgery if they keep their core strong to protect their spine. I would continue with physical therapy, and possible look into some type of posture correction while sitting.  I assume you sit for 8 hours a day at your job? Maybe look into buying a standing desk, this will help you maintain core strength, as it is very hard to do sitting for 8 hrs per day. Good luck.\n","I have not been on this board for the longest time.  Lots to share, but have been unable to make my posts appear.  I am hoping this will go through.

'dreams' of being still in bed or doing something else.. starting with strange tingling and floating away ensation..  my GP says it is Hypnogogia\n","I have exactly the same condition as you described!  Also, I am very sleepy after breakfast although I get seven or eight hours of sleep at night.  I am sort of \"night owl\".\n","This is the first time that I have heard anyone having something similar to what I have recently been experiencing. I'm pretty rattled.  I am a psychotherapist and two times this week I found myself in a \"dream\" while listening to a client, then saying something out loud to the client that had nothing to do with the conversation!  I said something from the \"dream\" which couldn't have lasted more than a few second.  I recently started taking the medication, Neurontin (gabapentin) but did not find this when reading about side effects.  Anyone can relate to this, please share...\n","During an induced 4 week coma following a heart operation I experienced what I thought were dreams but I now know to be NDEs.
