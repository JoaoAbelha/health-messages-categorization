So for finding that position of the word here we are gonna use nltk which tells us about the position of the word which then is used to get the sentiment using the sentiwordnet . We then average out the score for both the positive and the negative score from the whole sentence . The positions compatible with the sentiwordnet are:"],"metadata":{"id":"IMkIJTTOQ8So"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import nltk\n","nltk.download('stopwords')\n","nltk.download('punkt')\n","nltk.download('wordnet')\n","nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')\n","nltk.download('sentiwordnet')\n","import ssl\n","from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn\n","from nltk.corpus import sentiwordnet as swn\n","from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import nltk\n","from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize \n","import re\n","import spacy\n","\n","# Function to preprocess Reviews data\n","def preprocess_Reviews_data(data,name):\n","    # Proprocessing the data\n","    data[name]=data[name].str.lower()\n","    # Code to remove the Hashtags from the text\n","    data[name]=data[name].apply(lambda x:re.sub(r'\\B#\\S+','',x))\n","    # Code to remove the links from the text\n","    data[name]=data[name].apply(lambda x:re.sub(r\"http\\S+\", \"\", x))\n","    # Code to remove the Special characters from the text \n","    data[name]=data[name].apply(lambda x:' '.join(re.findall(r'\\w+', x)))\n","    # Code to substitute the multiple spaces with single spaces\n","    data[name]=data[name].apply(lambda x:re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', x, flags=re.I))\n","    # Code to remove all the single characters in the text\n","    data[name]=data[name].apply(lambda x:re.sub(r'\\s+[a-zA-Z]\\s+', '', x))\n","    # Remove the twitter handlers\n","    data[name]=data[name].apply(lambda x:re.sub('@[^\\s]+','',x))\n","\n","# Function to tokenize and remove the stopwords    \n","def rem_stopwords_tokenize(data,name):\n","      \n","    def getting(sen):\n","        example_sent = sen\n","        \n","        filtered_sentence = [] \n","\n","        stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english')) \n","\n","        word_tokens = word_tokenize(example_sent) \n","        \n","        filtered_sentence = [w for w in word_tokens if not w in stop_words] \n","        \n","        return filtered_sentence\n","    # Using \"getting(sen)\" function to append edited sentence to data\n","    x=[]\n","    for i in data[name].values:\n","        x.append(getting(i))\n","    data[name]=x\n","\n","\n","lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n","def Lemmatization(data,name):\n","    def getting2(sen):\n","        \n","        example = sen\n","        output_sentence =[]\n","        word_tokens2 = word_tokenize(example)\n","        lemmatized_output = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(w) for w in word_tokens2]\n","        \n","        # Remove characters which have length less than 2  \n","        without_single_chr = [word for word in lemmatized_output if len(word) > 2]\n","        # Remove numbers\n","        cleaned_data_title = [word for word in without_single_chr if not word.isnumeric()]\n","        \n","        return cleaned_data_title\n","    # Using \"getting2(sen)\" function to append edited sentence to data\n","    x=[]\n","    for i in data[name].values:\n","        x.append(getting2(i))\n","    data[name]=x\n","\n","\n","def make_sentences(data,name):\n","    data[name]=data[name].apply(lambda x:' '.join([i+' ' for i in x]))\n","    # Removing double spaces if created\n","    data[name]=data[name].apply(lambda x:re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', x, flags=re.I))\n","\n","\n","Edited_Review = df['text'].copy()\n","df['Review_without_stopwords'] = Edited_Review\n","# Using the preprocessing function to preprocess the hotel data\n","preprocess_Reviews_data(df,'Review_without_stopwords')\n","# Using tokenizer and removing the stopwords\n","rem_stopwords_tokenize(df,'Review_without_stopwords')\n","# Converting all the texts back to sentences\n","make_sentences(df,'Review_without_stopwords')\n","\n","#Edits After Lemmatization\n","final_Edit = df['Review_without_stopwords'].copy()\n","df[\"After_lemmatization\"] = final_Edit\n","\n","# Using the Lemmatization function to lemmatize the hotel data\n","Lemmatization(df,'After_lemmatization')\n","# Converting all the texts back to sentences\n","make_sentences(df,'After_lemmatization')\n","\n","\n","\n","pos=neg=obj=count=0\n","\n","postagging = []\n","\n","for review in df['After_lemmatization']:\n","    list = word_tokenize(review)\n","    postagging.append(nltk.pos_tag(list))\n","\n","df['pos_tags'] = postagging\n","\n","def penn_to_wn(tag):\n","    if tag.startswith('J'):\n","        return wn.ADJ\n","    elif tag.startswith('N'):\n","        return wn.NOUN\n","    elif tag.startswith('R'):\n","        return wn.ADV\n","    elif tag.startswith('V'):\n","        return wn.VERB\n","    return None\n","\n","\n","# Returns list of pos-neg and objective score.
