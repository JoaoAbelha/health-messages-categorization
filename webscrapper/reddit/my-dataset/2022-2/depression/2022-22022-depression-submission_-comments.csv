i03tj2t,t3_tayu7x,"Using it for a few months, off it for a few months, this didn’t give the lexapro enough time for my body + mind to adjust and benefit. Once I did stay on it for a little over a year consistently, my doctor and I saw what the changes were. I switched meds + higher dose. I think lexapro is the safest drug to handle a habit of inconsistent use? But not the most helpful for my experience.",t3_tayu7x,1646920150.0

I feel kind of embarrassed almost like i don't want that pity concern but at the same time i want someone to talk to.I've had thoughts of suicide from a very young age, and i've hid this for years. Being at uni now has made me worse as i feel lonely, i just see no point in carrying on. I haven't kept a good sleeping or eating pattern lately because i'm actually starting to give up.I'm not sure what to do, i wish there was an easy way out. I think if i forced myself to go outside and go to my lecture it may help, but i'm so low i can't.Also being in my lectures recently triggered me as it actually made me feel more alone.",t3_taybo3,1646920333.0

i03hm98,t3_tawxam,"Sorry to say but most of us who have been in your situation and eventually found someone, find that while it helps in some aspects, it can make you feel much worse in others, and it's not as grand as you might imagineFor example, after my whole life of being ""forever alone"" I found myself in a relationship with a girl I love who loves me, but my depression and my anxiety is even worse now.Why? Well because the beliefs that I'm not good enough, the insecurities I have, the anxieties I have etc, they will find a way to present themselves and make your life hell whether you are alone or with a partner, and since relationships are complicated stuff, and there's another person involved who you ideally love, it often just adds  a whole another layer of fuckery on top of your existing issuesWhat I'm trying to say is, don't put all your hopes for getting better into a girlfriend/boyfriend, because you might find yourself in a world of pain, no matter how much you love them or they love you. If your life is completely fine and you have no issues other than being single, please disregard all I said, but I'm thinking there's probably more that you aren't mentioningI know you might brush off what I say because ""of course it's not much to you since you already have someone"", but just in case you are open minded, I'd like you to give it a think",t3_tawxam,1646913363.0

i03fysb,t1_i03fgq0,"Likewise, also, once your body adjusts more, I'd say try taking them in the daytime again after awhile to test if it still gets you drowsyThe reason I say that is cause I was going to mention, don't rely on medication for your anxiety/depression cause with time you'll really be dependent on them, see if the side effect goes away so you can only take it when you start to feel shitty you know? Just a word of advice cause if I don't take my Xanax I'll be depressed asf and have anxiety attacks throughout the day, that came from a long time of depending on them.",t3_tawfco,1646912188.0

i030dk6,t3_tatj0a,"I’m so sorry you’re feeling like that. I started to get the birthday dread probably starting around 26 and I thought it would only get worse but I was pleasantly proven incorrect. There are lots of successful people who start being successful after they turned 30. Julia Child, Alan Rickman, Harrison Ford, Stan Lee, my mom, countless other everyday people just trying to make it. I’m not successful yet, I dropped out of a PhD program at 24 when my life was falling apart, I got divorced and was homeless for a little bit and I felt like ending it all more times than I can count. Still can’t get a job in my field of expertise so my schooling feels like a huge waste. I got crappy little jobs, started small, moved to a different state just before I turned 30. I spent a few years soul searching and really trying to figure out what I wanted for the rest of my life and this fall come hell or high water I am going to go back to school and work like a beast until I get where I want to be. It’s not easy but worthwhile things rarely are. I’ll be 33 in a couple months and I finally feel like getting older is a gift and not a curse. A birthday is a reminder that you made it to another year. 30 is young. Hell, to me 55 is young. You’re strong enough to get to 30, just hang on, don’t give up. We’re still young and there is so much the world has in store for us if we just keep trying. If I gave up at 30 I’d have robbed myself of so much joy. I’m not saying I don’t get depressed, I battle my depression like it’s a demon only I can see. But there is still so much beauty and goodness on this earth and it’s worth fighting for.
