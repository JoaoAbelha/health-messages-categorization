First day sober in 3 weeks only because I'm broke. Lately for me its been difficult again to see purpose in life, in my life. Each day is a repeat of the last, just one long endless loop. It's not that I need something to just snap out of it, but more so I'm exhausted of living. It's a chore to do everything. I'm really lazy and depressed. I don't work or do anything that makes me contribute to this world. I have everything handed to me yet I'm still not happy. Really I'm just a waste. I hate myself so damn much because I just never amount to anything other than being useless. I know I can't see the future, but seriously I don't see myself in a successful job, or having a family, or being happy. I just have such a negative but true view on life and myself that I'm never going to be functional. How do you change someone who doesn't want change? We are born, live, then die. Life is short, long, in between. Why do I matter? No one sees me. I'm alone, no friends, relationships are a joke but I'm so lonely. Girls don't notice me. I'm ugly and fat, I sweat a lot. I'm literally a loser. I don't know, I really question staying alive. Its not getting better, if anything worse. I'm 23 and there is no way I'm doing this at 40 probably still alone and at home still if I'm even alive. I have so much more I want to say but I'm overwhelmed with it all. I just want to disappear forever."

tazhlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tazhlh/any_adviceexperience_to_be_there_for_a_friend/,,1646921328.0,"I’ve had moderate depression all my life and thankfully I’ve rarely been suicidal and no longer self harm but it’s definitely impacted my life. I’m on meds that seem to be working as I almost feel like myself again but I still struggle with lack of energy, motivation, and passion. For me the hardest part is just starting anything but I’m still managing. Last year I lost a good friend to suicide and it was totally unexpected and hit very hard. Every sunday (the day they passed) I get uncontrollably sad and miserable and cry my heart out and sometimes I get drunk but other than that I am managing life. My best friend recently opened up about their struggle (I knew they were sad sometimes but not to this extent) and they’re very much struggling with suicidal thoughts, self harm, and really depression and anxiety. They say they feel like a dead man walking and that every action feels like their last (f.e. last dinner, last movie, ect.) and that everything is just so fucking exhausting. That they don’t belong anywhere, a burden nobody knows what to with, they don’t care about anything, they nonstop make every single possible mistake they can, that no one really understands and they can’t stop crying. I’ve made and brought them a little care package with food, books, a facemask, chocolate, and flowers but I don’t know what else to do. When I’m in crisis the only thing I want is just for somebody else to be there and I get that everyone is different but if they don’t want me there what can I fucking do?? I love them so incredibly much and can’t imagine my life without them and honestly I can’t lose anyone else or I’m not going to make it either. I’m just at a loss of what to do because I don’t have that much energy either and I can manage to do like a care package every now and then but I’m not fucking able to call/game/text 24/7. I’d move mountains for my friends but like I can’t hold them back for a long time. The most important thing when somebody is struggling I think is that when everybody says they care about you that they continue to back that up so it’s not just a one time “oh they’re not so good so I’ll send them a card.” Like I think a sustained effort or something is necessary but I’m not able to do that due to my own struggles. I wish I could go around and slap the sadness out of everyone but that’s not how it fucking works. Any advice for how to be there for them or what would help you the most when you’re in crisis would be appreciated. I really want to help and be there for them and I’m always ready to pick up their call but I’m not able to be on high alert 24/7 and I am struggling with my other things like classwork and even just managing my other relationships and like in a way I guess I’m okay with ruining my life if it keeps them alive but that is not the ideal situation!!! Any advice or just descriptions of what people did for you or what you wish they did would help. It fucking sucks. Everybody is so incredibly depressed and college is not worth it if it ruins your mental health and I get that it’s not just college but goddamn."

Usually I’ve been able to go to class, do homework, eat enough and sometimes even exercise but it’s all gone downhill. I cant focus in class, I never do any work, and today I skipped school to sleep. I’m in my grade 12 year too and if I don’t get good marks for midterms then it can be the reason I don’t get in to my top schools. I don’t even know if I’ll be able to handle university work if I’m still like this. On top of that I’ve been using opioids almost every day for the past week to deal with this and I think I’m starting to get addicted. I just feel so useless and stupid"

Getting sleepy and sleeping even after a good night sleep is concerning.. don't having a will to attend my classes and to study.. being unable to do workouts I used to do with ease.. whenever there is a situation I talk to people , I try to raise wierd topics , and sometimes try to make them sympathetic for me..having head aches whenever I try to study( feels like my body is repelling myself from being a good person) .. but still I wanna improve , I wanna be the person I was back then and even better than that. I'll tell you when it all started , I go to different institutions for study , so in my first one ( school) there were final terms whereas in my second inst. the course wasn't even completed . The thing was that I never really attended my school's classes as both had different study tropes and I didn't wanted the topics to mess up in my head , so when terms came I had to learn the chapters I didn't even  study for , and even had to make projects , as a result I had to leave the classes of my 2nd inst.. but now when things in my school's seems to be settled , I tried to join the classes but I am afraid of what they would make of me as I have two weeks of pending recordings for all those classes I have missed , that's when procrastination kicks in and other things I mentioned above.. even when I'm writing this , I am thinking that why I am playing the victim when everything was my fault , I didn't scheduled a thing . If I did things would have been different. I was unwilling to write this in the first place but I must write this to become better than what am I nowI hope all of you will help me"

I'm done making them my personal therapist knowing that we all have our own problems to deal with. I can't really blame them for being fed up and getting tired of me for all my rants and and sentiments about my unfair and lonely life but I am very graful for their listening ears and for their existence in general. I know that having a ""shoulder to cry on"" or having ""ears ready to listen"" isn't enough and I need to really seek the help of a professional but I don't have money to avail the service and I don't want my parents to find out that I'm dealing with this unbearable sadness and anxiety.

I've spent the last 15+ years working on average 55/60 hour weeks. For nearly half of that I was more or less a slave to my abusive family. I got absolutely no where. My social life began dying and I no longer talk to any of them. I somehow wound up married to my lovely wife.. But besides that I'm completely alone. I've totally isolated myself. I'm an unskilled worker. I've been in lower, middle management roles for the better part of the last decade. I am an anxious mess and I believe I have severe adhd(undiagnosed). BUT i still feel that i present myself as at least moderately intelligent. I was finally doing better, I had a decent salary position as a bakery manager.  I quit at the beginning of the year. Working through the pandemic I managed to stay healthy. Despite a staggering amount of my co- workers failing to do so. Which meant I got extra, extra work! Especially during lockdown, the grocery stores(where my bakery was) were SLAMMED. I worked about a full year of work weeks that were well above my ""required"" 50 hours. I was running two departments and down hundreds of hours of labor, all while breaking sales records. I pleaded for us to hire people, and eventually for time off. It was looking like I was going to get a solid week... WHEN another wave of quarantines hit. Long story short I pretty much had a mental breakdown and abandoned the job. That was in may of 21...Since then I worked a shift overnight at target for the holidays.. It was dockwork advertised as shelve stocking. Dockworkers in my area make 25$\~ an hour. I kept up just fine, but target was paying minimum wage and refused to let me go outside for my lunch break. So that didn't last long. More recently I did about 5 weeks at a burger king. I eventually walked out the other day. I was the ""cook"" drowning in orders. The place had been left an absolute shit show by the prior crew, whom also left 5 or minutes so early without a word.. I begged for help. A number of times. I was only there for an hour before I walked out. It felt like 12. My heart was beating out of my chest. I was so angry. My co-workers couldn't be bothered to stop talking/ get off their phones to help me. After one of them came over with some condescending bullshit, I put my headset down and walked out with a ""Fuck this"". Mind you, one of the 4 idle workers was a salaried manager. I was one of the newer employees.. As a person with a similar background - I would NEVER let someone struggle like that..&#x200B;Which brings me to now... While my wife makes decent money - I need a job. I have no clue what to do. I go from suicidal depressive moods, to productive OCD cleaning sessions. I'm losing my shit lol. The current events don't help either.. I'm just fucking tired of being taken advantage of. I'd jump into a volcano for a genuinely kind person.. But I'm so fucking tired of how shitty your average person is anymore"

I don't really feel I need advice or anything, this is purely for the sake of venting. A couple things real quick - I know I am at high risk for PPD and have already discussed medication with my doctor. Also (wasn't sure if clarification was needed on this one but) I have suffered depression my whole life, not just with pregnancy. And sorry this is long, I've been bottling a lot of this up for almost a week.I'm trying so hard not to stress out right now. Stress almost led to preterm birth by over a month (32 weeks + 7 days) last week, and since then I have been extremely depressed and kinda hating myself for letting my emotions put my already high-risk baby at even more risk. I got medical restrictions for work from my doctor but my store director AND manager are trying to refuse... I already plan on calling tomorrow (my first day back) and asking again if those work restrictions will be accepted. If not, I am quitting on the spot and recording the phone call so they can't try and pull one over on me when I tell the union and file for unemployment. But the idea of that phone call is stressing me out. My husband and I won't have any income and what if I can't get unemployment for whatever reason? Idk how to support my family and no one is going to hire someone who's 33, almost 34 weeks pregnant. I also got some really upsetting news yesterday that I am not able to be rehired at my old job, ever. It was kinda devastating because they have fantastic benefits, my team there loved me (the manager argued with the store director for hours about appealing this) and it's the only place I've worked where I just felt I belonged. I gave my two weeks when I left but called out on the last day (it's a very long story but I was suffering re-injury from a surgery I had recently healed from), so they had grounds for termination. That was devastating and I'm kicking myself really hard for calling out on that last day and quitting that job in the first place. I'm regretting the past so badly and if I could go back I'd slap myself for thinking I had a better opportunity at a place that had no insurance benefits that I didn't know. I ended up getting fired after a month at the new place because my morning sickness was too ""inconvenient"" for them (which I know is 100% illegal but I was too sick and stressed at the time to take action or really care). I miss the old job so much. The higher-ups there really sucked but my direct manager and the others in my department were amazing and I don't think I'll ever find kind of supportive circle in a job again. And side rant, I found out from my sister (who I consider one of my best friends) recently that my mom had been twisting both of our words and causing drama between us on purpose. My sister visited from out of state but before she got here, there was a ton of drama due to my mom twisting some words I said and that's actually what led to almost going into labor last week. Both my sister and husband told me not to go off on her and I mean... they're right that I shouldn't. I live under her roof and she is very good at manipulating her way around everything and gaslighting. I have tried and failed TONS of times throughout my life to call out the bullshit and it will never work. I feel so powerless in the situation but there is seriously nothing I can do except keep working towards moving out, which I can't do without a job. My husband has a lot of health issues and none of them qualify for disability, so it's up to me but I can't do anything.I've been really numb and shell-shocked these days by the whole situation. I'm powerless at work because I'm pregnant and the future is looking bleak and I'm starting to feel like I won't be a good enough mother for my son. I really badly want to provide for him and I feel like I'd be a great mom if I had better resources. But right now I have nothing and it feels like I'm never going to be enough for him. It's getting harder and harder to be optimistic about the situation and family I'm bringing him into. I'm going to try my best and give him everything I can, but right now I hate myself because I feel like I have nothing to give. On top of that he's stuck with a mom who's mentally ill and overall a mess. I wish I could be better for him and my husband. I wish I was good at a career path aside from art and baking, but nice-paying office work is out of the question thanks to my ADHD. And I'll be dropped from insurance a couple months after the baby is born so I can't get treatment for that long-term. Everything just sucks, I've been angry at the world and angry at myself for not doing better. I wish I could transform into a completely different person for the sake of my family but I'm just stuck being me."

When I first heard about the news and when she got sent to the hospital I didn't know what to feel, I felt nothing. I couldn't see her for months and when I finally got to see her I thought I also wouldn't feel anything but the moment I saw her with almost balded look, I felt as something died inside me like I finally faced the reality that she doesn't have much long. I didn't shed a tear but without a second of thought, I was already hugging her but I still felt happy that I could see her again.After sometime she had to comeback to confinement I started to feel more nothing, the hobbies I used to do for hours feels so boring, the same food I ate everyday tasted so god-damned bland and every night I can't sleep properly because I don't want my mother to pass away while I'm having a goodnight's sleep.I don't know what I should do, my family is slowly going into debt and I cant do sh*t because I can't even get a job because I haven't graduated highschool yet. I just wanna be able to show her that I loved her, that I cherished her, that I was thankful for her.

I genuinely tried to believe in the law of attraction but instead I’m just left more heartbroken than ever and in a circle filled with people who keep telling me to just keep believing and because of my belief being weak it is my fault it’s not working. But truly I don’t know what to do. They didn’t tell me life as an adult would be this lonely. Nobody told me eventually everyone stops responding or wanting to know what’s actually going on in your life and that you’re not supposed to actually tell an honest answer when people ask. Apparently life was different before COVID, I wouldn’t know. I was in an abusive relationship since high school so it didn’t change my life at all until I left him post the beginning of COVID. And I can’t help but feel, maybe I just jumped too late. I took my leap into freedom into another trap. This post is pointless.

I’m trying to do everything I know that helps, but this time around it isn’t doing effect. I work out everyday, eat healthily, do therapy and I try very hard to change my depressed perspective about everything.But none of this is changing a thing. I feel like shit everyday. I’m consumed by anxiety for working home office. I can’t focus or summon the will to want things anymore. I’m hopeless, I just can’t see meaning to life anymore. I don’t see the point anymore. All this effort for what? To barely survive? I don’t really feel like taking my life, if I’m here even if suffering I don’t see the reason not to continue till the end, life is an one time thing. I trying one.So, I wanted to hear different perspectives about medication and what to expect. I already tried zoloft and lexapro some years ago and it didn’t help, but at the time I overcame it with therapytl;dr rant about trying to fight depression and not succeeding"
tawabx,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tawabx/i_just_need_to_write_stuff_down/,,1646910209.0,Been severely depressed for the past few weeks now. Like not one second goes by where i dont think of a plan to kms because the feeling gives me comfort. I cant talk to any of my friends when im down because they would just shun me cuz they dont know how to deal with me and im tired of losing friends. I pretty much have no friends left. Why am i like this? I used to be so charasmatic in 2019 but since then ive been lazy. Motivationless. Tired. Im too tired to even keep working a full time job. Nothing seems worth it. Idk how people go to school and get degrees when I cant even handle my own shit. It makes me feel so worthless and stupid. It sucks cuz i am really creative and can be good at things i like. But im just too depressed to put in the effort anymore. Then theres the lonlienss. Ive never had a friend i could just hug anytime. The only time i had a girl in my life she ruined my life. Ive been used by so many people i dont even wanna talk to anyone anymore because im scared of opening up to someone and they ghost me. People have been so cruel to me and ALL IM DOING IS JUST TRYING MY BEST. its so hard to be social. And the depressions is just the kick off the edge for me. Fucking hell i want it to end. I just want to feel happy. How do you not let depression win?
taw8q6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/taw8q6/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,,1646910030.0,"Hi, I'm a 21 years old university student, sorry if I make mistakes, it's my first post on reddit and English is not my first language. I have a history with depression, I think, I've never been diagnosed, but I've struggled a lot through high school. Now old patterns are coming back.I cannot force myself to do anything productive, I don't go to class, I cannot study, I literally spend most of my days in bed on my phone or reading.I still do normal people stuff, I go out with my friends, talk with my family, but I feel like it's all just a farce.I've been developing a lot of self destructive behaviors, I smoke a lot, I go to bed really late and wake up super early. I actually enjoy being tired, it's like a punishment I can easily enforce on myself.I feel a sense of familiarity with these feeling and I actually enjoy it, as sick as it sounds. I feel emotionless most of the time and at least hating myself makes me feel something.There is no actual reason I should feel like this, I have a great life, a nice family, friends and a lot to look forward to in my future.Please tell me what should I do, I feel like I'm jeopardizing my future and I don't know how to stop."
taw6zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/taw6zg/i_cant_get_the_help_i_need_and_i_feel_like_im/,,1646909850.0,"Hey, my name is David. I’ve been feeling depressed for a couple of months now, and I’m at the worst low I’ve ever had.I have spoken to my therapist about it but she just keeps focusing on my sleep and stuff and never really gets into anything else I tell her about. That being said, I can’t really tell her everything because if I do get a diagnosis, it could halt my process of getting HRT, because it is very strict where I live and it’s a lot harder to get it if you have a diagnosis of, for example, ADHD, autism or depression. I’m at the very end of it and I will likely get on Testosterone this year, so I really can’t risk anything. The main reason I am depressed is because of loneliness. You would probably imagine it being something to do with being trans, and although that does play a big role in it, it’s actually not the driving factor as of right now. I don’t feel like I have any real friends where I live. I have friends who live in other cities and stuff, but I am stuck here for a few more years so i can’t really connect with them as much as I’d like to. I’ve told my classmates that I feel safest around that I need help, especially getting to my classes and stuff, as that’s something I struggle with, and also just to socialise. I literally asked if they could just try to talk to me sometimes, and maybe invite me to things like a movie or just to go to the mall. None of them have helped…This hurts especially much because last year (on my birthday) our former classmate killed himself. My whole class literally had to experience someone we cared about committing suicide. He never even asked for help, he just posted a little thing about how he was done on his Snapchat story, and the next thing we knew is that he was found dead. Yet when I reach out and ask for help and specifically tell them that I am depressed and need them, they don’t even bat an eye. I understand that it’s not my classmates job to get me to stop being depressed, but that’s not what I’m asking of them either. I’m literally asking them to do the bare minimum because I have nowhere else to go, and they don’t even try. I’m just really struggling and my attempts at getting help don’t work so I honestly don’t know what more I can do. I don’t want to lose this year and have to retake it or something, or just completely lose interest in everything I care about, but that is honestly where it’s headed right now and that thought in itself is making me feel even more helpless and lost"

My heart is broken but I also cannot leave her. My phone is taken from me most of the time so that I focus on my peace but whenever I get phone I reach her because I cannot see her go anywhere else.

I hate myself for not even being able to do work in my easiest class and my complete inability to fully get through a week of school. And it makes it even worse because I can’t even pinpoint a reason I started spiraling down like this, so I feel like there is just no reason I should be like this. Yes, I get that these are the thoughts that happen during depression but I still can’t help myself in feeling so useless and like a failure when my teachers talk to me and I’m around people my age. It’s really petty, but I honestly felt really backstabbed by my government teacher today. I emailed a few of my teachers a few weeks ago explaining how I was depressed and that was the reason I wasn’t turning in work. I didn’t expect them to just give me A’s but I was just hoping for SOME pity and them working with me through this. My gov teacher gave me a very nice response initially, saying something along the lines of: “I totally get it, I’ve had personal experience because my son went through the same thing and just take all the time you need, I’m here for you.” and I was stoked cause I thought that was like one less class I didn’t have to stress about. I’m honestly still very behind in that class, but I’ve been chipping away at it the best that I can. Today, we were supposed to take a quiz, and of course, I didn’t take it because I just assumed that she would know I wouldn’t be able to take it… because I’m like 3 weeks behind and depressed out of my mind. But, of course, when we were going to lunch, she stopped me and started saying how I wasn’t communicating enough and that the ‘other students’ told her that they weren’t gonna take the quiz today and she didn’t understand why I didn’t do it. She basically shamed me for 5 minutes about all the work I haven’t done while there were still other kids in the room. Look, I get that I should’ve sent an email or something but I was too busy just trying to stay alive so I would appreciate it if you didn’t shame me man. It was just so frustrating because I thought out of all the teachers, she would understand because she’s seen it before, but there she was, making me feel very very shitty. I just don’t enjoy living anymore. I want to be all these things, but I can’t do it. I’ve tried all the things they recommend: going outside, exercising, therapy, reading. But the truth is, I’ve been on and off depressed for 8 years and it just feels like there’s no cure for me.  I'm just so tired"

May be just for a listening ear, not any practical help. I'm an Indian student living with my parents. My mother on hearing the news of covid out breaks stopped all possible human interactions even ours. Since 2020 March, our family hasn't gone out, buy groceries, talked to other humans. Now after 2 years every other home here is back to normal, cases have reduced a lot. I have gone to my college just to write my exams and that's it. After coming from college after giving my exams I am put on quarantine for a month. I've been giving offline exams for past 2 years and after every exam sessions I have to lock myself up in a room.. For 2 years it has been prison.. I endured all this without questioning my parents when nobody I knew even did 5 % of this all this while , and after having a messed up 2 years I asked my parents why do they continue strict protocols when the cases are just too low and have got 3 vaccines, they keep insulting me as if I am an entitled brat. They ask me why do I need to go out, have a normal life I used to have when poor people can't get a day's food. It was such a ridiculous way of ignoring my mental health. My mom behaves like a hypochondriac, putting every other thing coming from outside in soap, sanitizing phones, door handles, locking the gate so that nobody ever walks in the yard. When offline classes happen she just ask me to stay in hostels and leave home. My sister hasn't seen school for the past 2 years when all her classmates attended school for the past 1 year. She has developed social anxiety and depression. We both are trying our best to convince them that we should move on but all in vain. She is planning to stop this locking up thing only after a year when she expects that the virus would be wiped out. I know she is doing this coz she care and that is why I did everything as she said even after being a laughing stock in college. But continuing this when covid counts are so low doesn't make any sense. My mom is being  irrational and the amount of fear she has is scary. It's just not me whose mental health is in pieces. Both my parents and my sister are suffering too. How will I survive this coz as of now I have hit too low. Who is actually right here?

I absolutely hate Instagram but now I'm not sure if I'm isolating myself or trying to get better? I thought it was both but I'm starting to realize more and more that I just don't want anyone to fucking hurt me first. I'm tired of people leaving me or making me feel like shit or allowing myself to *let* others hurt me or abandon me. All I (F22) do is work, sleep, drink, smoke. I hate being at home but I don't feel motivated enough to leave. I love my friends but I just feel like I can't be myself around them anymore and I feel like they all fucking hate me. Shit, I fucking hate me. People always think I'm dumb. When I was younger, I was one of the smartest kids at school although I did live in a small town in Texas so there's that I guess. But I am smart, I used to love school. I love learning and math was my favorite subject. I wanted to get into Princeton on a math scholarship then switch majors and take psychology. But stuff at home was just getting worse. My mom and I were always arguing, my mental health was declining more and more. It feels like nothing has gotten better."

I thought for a moment “Wow, to think that she’s only two years away from 30 now.” Then I realized that we are almost the same age as I turned 26 at the end of last year. I started to cry and now I can’t sleep. I know everyone says life is short, but I didn’t realized it could be short. I didn’t felt the last 5 years passing, what I think happened two years ago is from 5 years ago. Doesn’t help I have up on life and did nothing all these years, just hid at home, going to bed late and waking up at noon. Since last year I managed to get even worst, and these days I’m almost always finally sleeping at 5 or 6am, after hours of watching mind numbing videos. If I don’t I just lie in bed with my thoughts and can’t sleep anyway.Now my youth is gone, and the problem is not just turning 30, it’s that it doesn’t stop. I’ll blink and I’ll be 30, another blink and I’m 40. I just want to go back so badly, I’ve been dealing with these feelings for over 10 years so its not like I was happy back then, but I would do anything to go back. At least everyone that mattered to me was alive, I still had hair and looked young and fresh. Now I am ugly, I look and feel so old. Yet mentally I am the same 15 year old waiting for my life to start, only now I no longer have any hope.I can’t take it anymore, can this stop please? I don’t want to do this anymore, it’s not fair."

It felt like I was constantly walking on eggshells. I dealt with that feeling for almost a year and I’m still working over it.Recently, someone else has come into my life. We started off great having an easy-flow conversation, but it feels like because we became a little close, they’re trying to do the same thing. He told me, “just letting me know”, out of nowhere too, that he was going to kill himself. And about an hour ago, we were having an emotional conversation about my mental health and he was supportive &amp; understanding too. When I was justifying something, he said he wasn’t enough? (Didn’t relate at all) then left me on read for half an hour, came back and told me he was going to do it. I just don’t know how to help him, and the way he approaches the topic makes me nervous. It just feels like I have no idea where he’s coming from, and I’m healing from a friendship that went downhill for this exact reason, and because of that I just won’t ever say the right thing at all.I feel like I lack simple empathy. I can talk about my problems forever and ever, but I can never help someone through theirs.

tasxi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tasxi4/i_am_so_fucking_exhausted/,,1646895563.0,"Originally I posted this on r/OffMyChest, but I figured it was more relevant here, especially to gain helpful advice.I am so exhausted. Of life. Living itself. Every day is dreadful. I feel like I've been taking losses nonstop for the past 2 years (more like 6, but especially the last 2). Let me explain.Let's go back to high school (first year, or grade 9 in Ontario, Canada, 2016). I was a pretty cheerful guy. Did well in my courses. I worked diligently to get work done and study before tests. By the end of the first year, I had started to realize, that although work was getting done, I was forcing myself to do it even when I felt awful. I started to wonder if I was depressed.Second year (grade 10) comes around. Again, I do well in my courses. On top of the material for the most part, studying before tests, 90+ average for the most part. But I started searching for depression symptoms this year, and I began to realize that a lot of the things I had been feeling (hopelessness, nihilistic thoughts, suicidal thoughts here and there, and worthlessness). Nonetheless, I took pride in academics.Now, third year (grade 11). Pretty much a repeat of grade 10, but with higher intensity of negative thoughts/feelings. I start to realize that I truly may be depressed, but I have yet to seek help. I had readjusted my sleep schedule so I could avoid the fighting going on in my house, so I could wake up rested, unaffected (to some degree) from the drama, so I would be able to do my work in peace. This would pretty much consist of me coming home at 4PM and going straight to sleep until around 7-9PM, shower+eat, and working for 6-7 hours straight until around 3-4AM, then I would go to sleep, wake up at 6AM to go to school, and repeat it all again. 7PM would be around the time my aunt would come back from work, and since she started the fights 90% of the time, this sleep pattern helped me avoid listening to it. In hindsight, it was fucked up, but it was effective. Keep in mind, there was at least one or two fights weekly in my house from as long as I can remember (maybe about 4 years old). I still took pride in doing well academically; I remember getting my first 50 on a physics test and I was crushed, and from that point on I never saw a 50 again for the rest of the year.Final year (grade 12). I am happy it's going to be my last year. However, I start to feel a drop in performance. I am struggling a little to keep up with work, but nonetheless it gets done. I feel what I think they call senioritis, which I guess could be described as an increase of apathy regarding academics. The depressive symptoms are still there, but nonetheless I push through. I was not using the sleeping pattern mentioned above, which perhaps contributed to the academic struggle a little bit. From what I remember the fights were not as frequent. During the second semester of this year is when COVID-19 hit Ontario and lockdown was implemented. They told us we would not be returning to class after March Break. So, about a week or so after March break, online classes are implemented, but the school board told us we would not be seeing a decrease in grades even if assignments were not done/handed in late; the mid-semester report mark would be maintained, or only changed if our grade went up by handing in the assignments/tests. So, during the first and second weeks of online school, I had a really awful (what I would describe) as a depressive episode. I had done absolutely nothing except jack off and eat garbage the whole 1-2 weeks. None of my assignments were done. I was only focusing on one out of the 3 courses I was taking (I had a spare period at the time). This is the first time in my life that school had felt manageable, and like I didn't want to die that much. I was genuinely happy. Anyways I got into my top university pick (U Of T) and I am ready to get back to the grind...NO THE FUCK I'M NOT. Something about the first year man... The online classes/tutorials/practicals just led me to not want to try. Maybe it was the lack of social interaction; by nature, I am an introvert, but to me it takes much more effort to speak to people online than in person, because when you are in person, they people are right beside or in front of you, you need to work with these people when doing experiments, for example. All the grades were jumbled up on the website we use (canvas). What I mean by this is that the reported grades you see on the grades section might mean absolutely nothing if you read the syllabus. I don't know exactly how to describe it. To add to this mess, the first midterm I did resulted in me getting a 50% on it. I had never seen a 50 in a long time, especially not for an exam. From that point on it's pretty much been a downward spiral... I don't take pride in doing well academically anymore. If I see a 50 or a fail on a midterm, a final, even in a course, I think ""oh well, next time, or I'll retake it or something"". These numbers don't faze me anymore, I am unbothered by them. I think this is the coping mechanism I've developed; and because I've never experienced this level of failure before, I don't know how (or don't have the will for that matter) to fight for what I want anymore. The first thought is ""oh well, I had it coming"", then I beat myself up for not trying harder and being disciplined, but then next time comes around, and the same results appear.  I don't have mountains of money to keep this up. My mom has savings for my education (single-parent, only child here), and I work part-time, but that doesn't mean all is well. By the way, not to mention part-time work... I got a job at the local Dollar Store during the second semester of my first year; by far the most draining experience of my life. Because it was still the semi-lockdown era, the store needed people running around between cash, monitoring  the store capacity of customers, and merchandising. I was working anywhere between 15-25 hours a week, and by the time I got home I was ready to sleep, I had nothing left in me to do schoolwork. Because it was my first job, I wanted to come in for my scheduled hours as much as possible, and say yes when getting called in as much as possible, in order to keep it for at least a year or so. Anyways aside from that, I've lost the drive to do schoolwork. I've concluded that my life is meaningless so long as I stay a university student and work a ""normal"" job. If I had to be honest, my ultimate goal would be to become a successful content creator, preferably on YouTube. I've looked up to so many people on there as father figures; it seems only natural to want to provide that to the next generation of single-parent children. But, the fact of the matter is that although this type of work may provide fulfillment while allowing me to have a career, it does not produce stability whatsoever. For someone who wants to have a family, I don't think it would be a good idea to pursue this career full-time; it is not realistic, and if you ask me, requires some element of luck. However, I am failing at the so-called ""stable"" choice already, so what the fuck is the point in anything? Nothing seems worth it anymore! I just want to be at peace! But all this bullshit keeps eating away at me. I now have essentially no more will to keep going. I am not alive, I simply exist, waiting for death to put me at ease, since I don't have the nerve to do it myself. Nowadays (now in second semester, second year), I only have 1 shift a week, and believe it or not my course load is manageable, I just have no drive or will left to get it done. My friends have been telling me that I am experiencing burnout (I hesitated coming to this conclusion since I don't do much at all, but they explained that it might be from years of hard work in high school). They say I should take a year off to figure myself out, but my family would definitely not be happy about this, and furthermore I am worried that I will fall into a hole so deep of simply having no goals left and just working dead-end jobs until I die, to the point that I may never return to University. It all seems so pointless, like it doesn't matter, because in the end I'll probably end up unhappy, full of regret, and depressed anyway. I'm not sure what to do. Believe me, I've tried sucking it up, it doesn't work. The days I do get productive, my heart races all day with extreme anxiety, and by the time I get some work done, I have a mental breakdown and fall back into this depressed, unproductive, undisciplined state. I'm not sure where to go from here. I have seeked help from a therapist via my university's mental health service, but that's not happening for about 2 weeks. Given that I have a storm of work coming in the next 2 weeks, the therapist will have nothing to help me with until after everything is over, and I feel.like many of the things I have to do will either be done poorly or submitted late. If anyone has any suggestions about what I should do, it would be greatly appreciated."

I'm at the mercy of three illnesses - retinitis pigmentosa (overtime causes a decrease in vision), bipolar disorder, and I'm hard of hearing.I spent my whole life learning to live differently. Right now, all I have is night blindness and it makes life difficult. Imagine never being able to go out at night because it's dark. Your eyes don't adjust and so when you go to a movie theater or drive at night, you might as well close your eyes because it's that dark. Flashlights do help, but they don't illuminate much. During the day, it's a different story and I seem normal.Bipolar disorder - well... don't confuse the movies and real life. For me, I experience episodes of deep depression and then episodes of mania. It's hard being so depressed you can't even get out of bed to take a leak or eat food and other times, I'm running on 3 hours of sleep being the best employee at work. I fought to have a normal life. I fought to get my education, battle the social isolation caused by vision loss and mental illness, and did things nobody else thought I would. I travelled the world, heck I even competed in martial arts as long as I had enough vision to be able to win (and I did).But now, I had a brain tumor. And having it removed severely damaged my hearing. I didnt think my life would get this much harder, after all, having it made myife unliveable. I honestly thought i was going to die. Three months later I'm plagued with 24/7 tinnitus, a quieter world where my only refuge are two very expensive devices for each ear, balance issues and feeling confused as to why I must go through this.People have told me I was their hero and inspiration. They told me that to be able to have done what I've done so far in my life, inspired them to do better. They told me I was so empathetic, so kind, so tough, and so confident. I was only like that to keep my mind off the pain I feel each day. Don't get me wrong, I deeply love others, but my illnesses make it harder to show that I love others.I was active and healthy. People told me not only did I inspire them to do things like read, further their education, stand up for themselves, or get in shape the way I did. I was very disciplined - performance of an athlete with good looks to match.I wish the brain tumor killed me. I can't commit suicide because I'll break the hearts of the ones that loved me.Yes, I'm taking medication, and yes I'm going to therapy (my therapist is aware I feel this way). I've called the suicide holiness many times, I've been in a psychiatric hospitalization, I've even done sheooms and weed hoping it'll help But no, right now... I'm just tired of being alive. I'm tired of always having to fight harder than everyone else and find a ridiculously elaborate method of doing simple tasks. Maybe these feelings will pass, but I'm tired.I'm even tired of being a hero to people. To the., I make their problems more bearable because they see someone like me making it in the world, in spite of what they see as much worse.I don't see myself taking my own life anytime soon, but I do see myself not caring if I died. I'm just tired."
